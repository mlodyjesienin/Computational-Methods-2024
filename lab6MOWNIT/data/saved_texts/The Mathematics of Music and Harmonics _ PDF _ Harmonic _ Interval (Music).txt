It explains that music is based on octaves where notes are doubled in frequency. Western music uses 12 semitones per octave, where each step is a ratio of frequencies. Small frequency ratios like 3/2, 4/3, and 5/4 produce consonant intervals that sound pleasing. Chords are formed from small integer frequency ratios that create harmonious sounds. Dissonance occurs when note frequencies interfere, which can produce beats within the critical bandwidth of hearing. An equation is provided to calculate the dissonance between pairs of harmonics.Original Description: Copyright© Attribution Non-Commercial (BY-NC)Available FormatsPDF, TXT or read online from ScribdShare this documentShare or Embed DocumentSharing OptionsShare on Facebook, opens a new windowFacebookShare on Twitter, opens a new windowTwitterShare on LinkedIn, opens a new windowLinkedInShare with Email, opens mail clientEmailCopy linkCopy linkDid you find this document useful?0%0% found this document useful, Mark this document as useful0%0% found this document not useful, Mark this document as not usefulIs this content inappropriate?Report this DocumentDownload nowSaveSave The Mathematics of Music and Harmonics For Later0 ratings0% found this document useful (0 votes)228 views20 pagesThe Mathematics of Music and HarmonicsUploaded byJoão Nunes AI-enhanced descriptionThe document discusses key concepts in the mathematics of music and harmonics.
