Application of Calculus


A point, P,  moves on a circle with constant speed  according to the equations

x = r cos β

y = r sin  β



Question


Show that if r, the radius vector to P moves with angular velocity ω , and angular acceleration α

(a) speed = |v| = r ω

(b) acceleration = r ( ω 4 + α 2 )1/2



Answer


(a) Differentiating with respect to time, t:

vx = - r sin β (d β /dt ) = -r ω sin β

vy =  r cos β (d β /dt ) = r ω cos β

The speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector.  The magnitude of the velocity is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the components of velocity.

v = ( vx 2  + vy 2 ) )1/2 = r ω



(b) The acceleration in the x direction is given by the following expressions:

ax  = - r ω cos β  (d β /dt )  - r sin  β (d ω / dt) = -r  ω 2 cos β  -r α sin β

The acceleration in the y direction is given by the formula:

ay  = - r ω sin β  (d β /dt )  + r cos  β (d ω / dt) = -r  ω 2 sin β  + r α cos β

The magnitude of the acceleration is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of the components.





What is calculus and why it is used?

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that studies the rate of change; it is used to model systems where there is change. These models can be used to see what the effect of change is on one aspect of a system. When one aspect is changed, the effect of the change on the other aspects of the system can be observed.



What are the applications of calculus?

Calculus is applied in many areas of life. It can be used to model systems where there is change. Examples of the applications of calculus in scientific fields are space exploration, telecommunications systems, computer science, engineering, medicine, pharmacology, business, meteorology, and music.



When can you apply calculus in real life?

It is not always possible to sit down with a pen and paper and apply calculus directly in real life, except if calculus is one of your subjects or if you have an interest in it and like to do mathematics.

It is, however, possible to use things that were created because calculus exists and it works. This includes using electricity, computers, cell phones, TV and radio, cars, bridges, medical technology, and so on.

Calculus comes from a Latin word for pebble.






  What is Calculus?



The word calculus comes from Latin. Originally a calculus was a pebble used as a reckoning counter. The Romans used pebbles on a counting board to do addition and subtraction. The plural of calculus is calculi. There are two branches of calculus: 
differential calculus (differentiation) and 
integral calculus (integration). 
Differentiation studies the rate of change (or slope) of a function. In Figure 1, L shows the slope of the function at point P.  

Figure 1: Differentiation finds the slope.






 Integration is about adding small slices to make a whole and can be used to find the area under the function. Figure 2 shows how small blocks drawn under the function can be added together to find the area under the function.  

Figure 2: Integration finds the area under a function.






 Doing integration is the reverse of doing differentiation. 
Both differentiation and integration work by breaking the problem into very small parts. They are opposite in the sense that integration takes small parts and adds them together to form something bigger, while differentiation takes something (the function) and breaks it up into lots of small pieces to create a new function.  What is the Purpose of Calculus?Different branches of mathematics have different purposes. Some of the more well-known branches are: 
Arithmetic, dealing with numbers and basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Geometry, studying shapes. 
Algebra, using numbers and variables (like x, y, z) and solving equations. 
Trigonometry, studying the relationships between angles and the sides of triangles. 
Calculus, studying the rate of change in different quantities. 
Calculus can be used to model systems where there is change. These models can be used to make predictions. If one aspect of a system is changed, the likely effect of the change on the other aspects of the system can be observed. For example, the speed of something at a certain point can be modeled as a function of the initial speed, the acceleration, and the time that it traveled. The final speed can be predicted for changes in these three variables. In mathematics, the function is written as v = u + at where v is the final velocity, u the initial velocity, a the acceleration, and t the time. When u, a, or t is changed, v will change, and it is possible to see how much and why.

 Applications of Calculus



Most people don't sit down on a daily basis with a pen and paper, solving integration and differentiation problems to be able to live their daily lives. A lot of the people on Earth, however, use things that were created by the application of calculus. When studying differentiation and integration for the first time, it is not clear that these squiggles are used by architects when they design buildings, in equipment used for making medical diagnoses, in economics, business, meteorology, or even acoustics. A few examples of the applications of calculus in scientific fields are mentioned below. Each of them is a field of study on its own and the detail is beyond the scope of this lesson. 
Space exploration: In order for people and equipment to be safe on their journeys, many calculations are made. The orbits of planets, gravitational forces of the sun, moon, and other bodies are computed; speed, acceleration, and distances need to be known and these things need to be very accurate. 
Telecommunication: Satellites are part of our daily lives. Things like the TV, radio, and the Internet very often use satellites to transmit information. The satellites had to get up there in the first place and in addition to that calculus is also used in the processes in the telecom industry. 
Computer Science: Calculus is used for scientific computing, computer games, image processing, machine learning, networks, and many software programs, 
Engineering: Not one of the fields in engineering would probably exist today if there was no calculus. A few examples are structural, civil, electrical, mechanical, chemical, and biomedical engineers all making use of calculus. 
Medicine: Medical tests, cancer treatment, epidemiology, surgery, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology, parasitology, and medical research all make use of calculus in some form. 
Business: There are applications of calculus in economics, finance, and even credit card payments. 
Meteorology: Weather patterns are calculated and predicted using calculus. These things are important for agriculture, weather warnings, and assisting with disasters. 
Music: Calculus is used in harmonics and acoustics to provide the best listening experience possible. 
 Applications of Calculus in Real LifeWhat is the application of calculus in real life? 
In the morning, a lot of people are woken up by an alarm and switch on the lights. They make coffee and cook breakfast. Many people decide what to wear by consulting the weather forecast, using some form of technology, e.g. the TV, radio, or their cell phone. Then they plan the best route to work by using some form of route planner that tells them where the traffic is congested, where the traffic police are, and in some countries, people can even find out where potholes are in order to avoid them. Other people work from home by using the Internet and telecommunications. And these are a few examples from the first few hours of the day. As the day goes by, application after application of calculus is used to have fun, exercise, and relax, among other things. But what about my life? After reading all of this, the perceived problem may still be that it is all good and well that people use tools that other people created using calculus, but there is still no way in which ordinary people can apply calculus in real life. Therefore we will look at some applications that people can use for themselves in their worlds.  Differentiation can be used when we want to know the rate.  Example 1: A water tank is being filled with water. The easy way of finding the rate at which it is filled is by measuring the amount of water that goes into the tank every second. It is then possible to say that the rate is 12 drops per second, 50 liters per second, or whatever the case may be. With a bit more patience, it will be possible to measure the volume of water that goes in per time period and write a mathematical equation like V(t) = 3/4 t, where V is the volume of water in the tank and t is the time that it took to get there. If the volume is in liters and the time is in seconds, we can now say that the rate is 3/4 liter per second, which is the same as the derivative of the function. This type of function will not always be as simple as V(t) = 3/4 t, and it is especially in the more complicated cases where differentiation comes in handy. Example 2:  Peter wants to deposit his money in the bank. The bank promises an interest rate of 2% per year. When trying to figure out what the best way will be to invest his money at which institution, Peter will have to look at different types of interest and different interest rates. If he uses mathematical functions and differentiation to look at his options, he will be able to find where his money will grow at the best rate.  Integration can be used when we want to know the total quantity.  Example 1: Matthew is an educational psychologist. He has to see 34 children before the end of the week. If he can find out how much time it will take to see each child, he can add all the individual times together to find how long it will take him to see all 34 children. When he does this, he uses the principles of integration, as integration is finding the total by adding up the little pieces. Example 2: Susan wants to create a beautiful mosaic. She has a picture of what she wants to make and has to go to the tile shop to buy the necessary tiles. She needs to know how many tiles of each color to buy. Usually, a person buys big tiles and breaks them into smaller pieces. Her strategy is to look at the picture and count how many small pieces of each color are used. She counts 20 light yellow pieces, 80 light brown, 6 sea-green, and so on. In her estimation, the pieces will be 1 cm x 1 cm. The 6 sea-green pieces will therefore need 6 {eq}cm^2 {/eq} of tile, the light brown will need 80 {eq}cm^2 {/eq} and so on. When Susan added up all the small pieces to find out what the whole would be, she used the basic principle of integration.  

Susan wants to create a mosaic and uses integration to determine which tiles to buy.

 Why is Calculus Important?



Technological innovation is done by applying scientific knowledge to create something new. When looking at calculus, there are endless possibilities for creating new things, as can be seen from what has already been done up to now. The technological innovations described above are only the tip of the iceberg of what can be done and what will be done in the future. People will continuously imagine new things and come up with new ideas, and for many of those things, the application of calculus will be part of bringing those ideas to life.

When small pieces are added up to find the total quantity of something bigger, e.g. emptying the piggy bank and adding up all the money to see how much there is, the principles of integration are used. For all of us, the applications of calculus will continue to play a significant role in future technological innovations.

What is Calculus? Calculus is the branch of mathematics that studies how things change, and what the effects of changes are on a system. Calculus is derived from the Latin word ''calculus,'' which means ''a small pebble used for counting.'' Calculus has two main branches: differential calculus and integral calculus. Differential calculus studies how things change when considering the whole to be made up of small quantities. In other words, differential calculus deals with all the small components or parts that make up the whole system. Integral calculus is complementary to differential calculus: it studies the whole system as an accumulation of small quantities or components. In simple terms, differential calculus breaks things up into smaller quantities to determine how small changes affect the whole. Integral calculus puts together small quantities to determine how the whole is formed from the small quantities and is affected by the small changes. Mathematicians use calculus to find information about changes to a system or whole, in addition to many other uses. These findings are useful in all sorts of different areas; that means calculus has many applications in real life.  
Calculus in Everyday Life Consider a swimming pool that's filled by water dripping from a tap. At any point in time, you can theoretically add up all the small drops to find the total volume of water in the tank. This is an application of integral calculus because it uses small droplets of water to determine the whole volume of water at any point in time. On the other hand, if you would like to know the rate at which water is filling the pool, you could count the number of drops per second that drip from the tap. This is differential calculus because it considers how small droplets fill the tank without actually determining the total volume of water in the tank. There are other everyday applications, too. Imagine you have a piece of cardboard, of which you already know the length and width. You want to build a box with the cardboard, and you're trying to determine what dimensions will give you the maximum possible volume for the box. This can be solved using differential calculus. Start with a small box with a length, width, and height of 1 unit (1 × 1 × 1). Keep increasing the height, width, and length in small increments, until you find the ideal dimensions using the piece of cardboard where the volume will be the maximum. Here you are considering small changes in dimension to identify the ideal dimension.  Calculus in the Business World Calculus can be used in business, as well. A grocery store owner wants to find the optimal time to display berries. She knows that berries will sell better if they're on display at a certain time, but since they're perishable, she doesn't want to leave them out all day to ensure they're on display at the ideal moment. How can the owner find the right time to display her product? 


This can be solved using differential calculus. The storekeeper could record the quantity of the product sold at different times during the day, then identify the time at which the product sold the most. Here, she is considering small increments of time to identify the rate of sales. Let's look at another example. You run a factory which manufactures a product in 50 steps; that is, there are 50 tasks to perform to create one unit. Using integral calculus, you can find out how long it takes to build each unit. Just find the time for each task, then add the individual times to calculate the total time for all 50 tasks. Different variables that affect manufacturing can be observed: for example, the rate at which a single task occurs, or the number of items that do not meet factory standards. The value of these variables can be analyzed using differential calculus to increase profit and production. Both integral and differential calculus are found in several branches of science, technology, and even engineering. For example, in many areas of science and even cinematography, 3-dimensional models can be used to create realistic environments. The models can be subjected to different changing conditions, and the changes over small periods of time can be studied using differential calculus. In engineering and architecture, integral calculus can be used to calculate the total amount of materials that would be needed to construct an entire wall, based on the materials needed to construct a portion of the wall. Biologists use differential calculus to determine the rate at which bacteria grows in a petri dish under constantly changing conditions, such as temperature and lighting over small periods of time.  Lesson Summary Integration and differentiation are two of the basic concepts in calculus. Integral calculus adds up all the small parts to find the whole, while differential calculus slices the whole into small parts to find the value or change over time of a small part. Integration and differentiation have many practical applications in real life because they're used to measure change. These applications include uses around the home, like calculating the time required to fill a swimming pool, or maximizing the use of practical crafts like boxes; or uses in work, from increasing the efficiency of assembly lines, to picking the right time to sell products.
