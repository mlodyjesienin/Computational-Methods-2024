(Image: AFP) Stephen Hawking, a brilliant theoretical physicist, left an indelible mark on the scientific world with his groundbreaking discoveries. Known for his exceptional mind and ability to unravel the mysteries of the universe, he made six most important discoveries, which have been described in detail below.Six most important discoveries made by Stephen HawkingBlack Hole Thermodynamics: Hawking's revolutionary work on black holes turned heads in the scientific community. Contrary to the belief that nothing could escape a black hole, he proposed that they emit a faint radiation, now famously known as "Hawking radiation." This discovery challenged long-standing ideas about the nature of black holes and their role in the cosmos.Hawking Radiation: Hawking radiation, a product of quantum effects near the event horizon of a black hole, suggests that black holes aren't entirely black. Instead, they emit particles and radiation over time, eventually leading to their slow evaporation. This groundbreaking idea fundamentally changed our understanding of the thermodynamics of black holes.The nature of the universe's beginning: Hawking delved into the origins of the universe, proposing that it began with a singularity ‚Äì a point of infinite density. His work, in collaboration with Roger Penrose, led to the formulation of the singularity theorems, suggesting that the universe's beginning could be traced back to an immensely dense state, laying the groundwork for theories like the Big Bang.Information paradox: Hawking's exploration of black holes raised a significant puzzle known as the "information paradox." The traditional view suggested that information falling into a black hole was lost forever, contradicting the principles of quantum mechanics. Hawking later proposed that information might not be entirely lost, sparking ongoing debates in the field of theoretical physics.ALS and longevity: While not a scientific discovery, Hawking's extraordinary resilience in the face of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showcased the human spirit's tenacity. Diagnosed at the age of 21, he defied medical expectations by living for more than five decades with the disease. His perseverance became an inspiration, demonstrating that the human mind can transcend physical limitations.The no-boundary proposal: In collaboration with James Hartle, Hawking proposed the "no-boundary" condition for the universe. This concept suggests that the universe has no distinct boundaries or edges, akin to the Earth's surface having no boundary. It provided a new perspective on the universe's beginning, offering insights into its structure and evolution.Stephen Hawking's discoveries, characterized by a deep understanding of the complexities of the cosmos, have reshaped our comprehension of black holes, the origin of the universe, and the fundamental laws governing reality. While Hawking is no more, his intellectual legacy continues to inspire us.FAQs1. What is Hawking radiation, and why is it important? Hawking radiation is a kind of faint radiation that Hawking proposed comes from black holes. It challenged the idea that nothing could escape a black hole. This discovery changed how we understand black holes and their behavior in the universe.2. How did Hawking contribute to our knowledge of the universe's beginning? Hawking, along with Roger Penrose, suggested that the universe started from a singularity‚Äîa point of infinite density. Their work on singularity theorems laid the groundwork for theories like the Big Bang, helping us understand how the universe might have begun.3. What is the information paradox in the context of black holes? The information paradox is a puzzle Hawking introduced. It questions the traditional idea that information going into a black hole is lost forever, which goes against the principles of quantum mechanics. Hawking's proposal that information might not be entirely lost sparked ongoing discussions in physics.4. How did Stephen Hawking's battle with ALS impact his legacy? Although not a scientific discovery, Hawking's ability to live more than five decades with ALS showcased remarkable resilience. His story became an inspiration, demonstrating the strength of the human spirit and its ability to overcome physical challenges.5. What is the "no-boundary" proposal, and how does it relate to the universe's structure? In collaboration with James Hartle, Hawking proposed the "no-boundary" condition for the universe. This idea suggests that the universe has no distinct boundaries, similar to the Earth's surface having no clear edge. It offers a different perspective on how the universe began and provides insights into its structure and evolution.
