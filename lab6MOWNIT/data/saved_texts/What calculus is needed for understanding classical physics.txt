In summary, calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of change and is essential for understanding classical physics. It involves the use of limits, derivatives, and integrals to analyze and solve problems related to rates of change and accumulation. The main concepts of calculus used in classical physics are derivatives, integrals, and differential equations. While a basic understanding of calculus is necessary to fully comprehend and apply the principles of classical physics, one does not need to be an expert in calculus. Some specific calculus techniques that are particularly useful for classical physics include the chain rule, product rule, and integration by parts. These techniques allow for the manipulation and simplification of equations, making problem-solving more efficient and accurate.

Hey guy, I'm a just new in physics and i want to self-teaching it. But i don't know what calculus i need for classical mechanic. Pleas help!
And if you suggest me a book can you pleas help to send me a link (and the book must be in pdf pleas)

Thank

For classical mechanics differential equation is more relevant and not covered in the Calculus until the very end.

but can be perused after the introduction to differential Calculus.

 





















Related to What calculus is needed for understanding classical physics

What is calculus?Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of change. It involves the use of limits, derivatives, and integrals to analyze and solve problems related to rates of change and accumulation.Why is calculus important for understanding classical physics?Calculus is essential for understanding classical physics because it provides a mathematical framework for analyzing and describing the motion of objects and the forces acting on them. Calculus is used to calculate quantities such as velocity, acceleration, and momentum, which are crucial in classical physics.What are the main concepts of calculus that are used in classical physics?The main concepts of calculus used in classical physics include derivatives, integrals, and differential equations. Derivatives are used to calculate rates of change and slopes of curves, while integrals are used to calculate the total change or accumulation of a quantity over a given interval. Differential equations are used to describe the relationship between a quantity and its rate of change.Do I need to be an expert in calculus to understand classical physics?No, you do not need to be an expert in calculus to understand classical physics. However, a basic understanding of calculus concepts is necessary to fully comprehend and apply the principles and equations of classical physics. With practice and application, the concepts of calculus can become more intuitive to understand.Are there any specific calculus techniques that are particularly useful for classical physics?Yes, there are several calculus techniques that are particularly useful for classical physics. These include the chain rule, product rule, and integration by parts. These techniques allow for the manipulation and simplification of equations in classical physics, making problem-solving more efficient and accurate.
