OverviewTest SeriesSet theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all mathematical objects. The basic concepts in set theory include set, element, subset, union, intersection, and complement. The concept of a set was developed by German mathematician George Cantor (1845-1918). Sets are also used to define the concepts of relations and functions.

What is Basic Set Theory?Basic set theory and functions are used as a foundation for many subfields of mathematics. It provides the axioms from which the rest of mathematics is built. In everyday life, we generally talk about a group or collection of objects. Surely you must have used the words such as team, bouquet, bunch, flock, family for the collection of different objects.It is very important to determine whether a given object belongs to a given collection or not. Consider the following collections: Successful persons in your city. Happy people in your town. Clever students in your class. Days in a week. First five natural numbers. The first three collections are not examples of sets, but the last two collections represent sets. This is because, in the first three collections, we are not sure of the objects. The terms ‘successful persons’, Happy people’, ‘Clever students’ are all relative terms. Here, the objects are not well-defined. In the last two collections, we can determine the objects clearly.Thus, we can say that objects are well-defined.Learn about Types of FunctionsUGC NET/SET Course Online by SuperTeachers: Complete Study Material, Live Classes & MoreGet UGC NET/SET SuperCoaching @ just₹27999₹12249 Your Total Savings ₹15750 Explore SuperCoachingWant to know more about this Super Coaching ?

We denote sets by capital letters A, B, C, etc. The elements of a set are represented by small letters a, b, c, x, y, z etc. If x is an element of a set A, we write \(\in\) A, and read it as ‘belongs to A’. If x is not an element of a set A, we write x \(\notin\) A and read as ‘x does not belong to A’. e.g. zero is a whole number but not a natural number.Types of SetsThere are the following types of set in basic set theory problems and solutions:Empty Set or Null Set: A set containing no element is called the empty set or the null set and is denoted by the symbol or void set.Example: A = {x: x is a prime number lying between 90 and 96} = ϕSingleton Set: A set containing only one element is called a singleton set.Example:Let A be a set of all integers which are neither positive nor negative. A={1}Let B be a set of Capital of India. B = {Delhi}Finite and Infinite Sets: A set in which the process of counting elements comes to an end is called a finite set. A set that is not finite is called an infinite set. Check the example for finite and infinite sets below.Example: Set of letters in the word “beautiful”.16) A = {a, b, e, 1, f, L, i, u)


Equal Sets: Two sets are said to be equal if they contain the same elements ie. if ACB and BCA.Example: Let X be the set of letters in the word ABBA’ and Y be the set of letters in the word ‘BABA’X= {A. B), Y= {B, A)Thus the sets X and Y are equal sets and we denote it by X = YEquivalent Sets: Any two sets are stated to be equivalent sets if their cardinality i.e the number of components present in both sets are the same.Example: A = {2, 3, 5} and B = {3, 5, 7} are equivalent sets since their cardinality is the same which is 3.Universal Set: If in a particular discussion, all sets under consideration are subsets of a set, say U.Then U is called the universal set for that discussion. You know that the set of natural numbers N, the set of integers Z are subsets of the set of real numbers R. Thus, for this discussion R is a universal set.Learn about Power SetMethods of Writing SetsO {\in} W (Where W is a set of whole numbers) and O {\notin} N (Where N is a set of natural numbers). There are two methods of representing a set, Roster or Tabular Method or list method Set-Builder or Ruler Method Roster or Tabular Method or List MethodThis method of representing a set by writing all its elements are called Roster method or Tabular method.Example: A= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}Learn about Cantor SetSet-Builder or Ruler MethodIf the elements of a set have a common property then they can be defined by describing the property.Example: A = {x : x is a natural number less than 9}


Learn about Types of RelationsSubset: Consider A and B to be two sets. If each element of A is present in set B then A is designated a subset of B and it is denoted by the notation A ⊆ B.Example: A = {2, 3, 5} and B = {2, 3, 5, 7}. Here we can recognize that all the components of set A are present in set B. So, A ⊆ B.Number of Elements in a Set: The number of distinct elements contained in a finite set A is denoted by n (A).Thus, if A = {1, 2, 3, 4), then n (A) = 4.Learn about Roster NotationSet OperationsThe four important set operations that are widely used are: Union of sets: The union of A and B is the set of all those components which belong to either A or B or both A and B. Intersection of sets: The intersection of A and B is the set of all those components which are present in both sets A and B. Complement of sets: Complement of set A contains the elements present in the universal set but not in set A. Difference of sets: The difference between A and B is the set of all those elements of A which are not present in B. It is expressed as (A – B) or A \ B.
