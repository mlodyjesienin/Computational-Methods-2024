It derives the 1-dimensional continuity equation and uses it to describe flow between parallel plates. It then derives the equation for laminar flow velocity profile between infinite horizontal parallel plates based on the Navier-Stokes equations and applies it to calculate discharge rate. Finally, it provides an example problem calculating discharge rate and power for an oil skimming device.Read lessRead moreReportShareReportShare1 of 35Download nowRecommendedInseInseSemereab Demissie Fluid dynamics 1Fluid dynamics 1guest7b51c7 XcChapter 4. diffrentialChapter 4. diffrentialkidanemariam tesera fluid mechanicsTWO DIMENSIONAL STEADY STATE HEAT CONDUCTIONTWO DIMENSIONAL STEADY STATE HEAT CONDUCTIONDebre Markos University This chapter contains:-.

It is also known as a bare number or pure number or a quantity of dimension one[1] and the corresponding unit of measurement in the SI is one (or 1) unit[2][3] and it is not explicitly shown. Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, and economics. Examples of quantities, to which dimensions are regularly assigned, are length, time, and speed, which are measured in dimensional units, such as meter , second and meter per second. This is considered to aid intuitive understanding.

An  oil skimmer uses a 5 m wide x 6 m long
moving belt above a fixed platform (θ=60º) to
skim oil off of rivers (T=10 ºC). The belt travels
at 3 m/s. The distance between the belt and the
fixed platform is 2 mm. The belt discharges into
an open container on the ship. The fluid is
actually a mixture of oil and water. To simplify
the analysis, assume crude oil dominates. Find
the discharge and the power required to move
the belt.                     g          x               h

 32. Example: Laminar Flow  (Team
               work)

Calculate the discharge of 20ºC
water through a long vertical section of 0.5
mm ID hypodermic tube. The inlet and outlet
pressures are both atmospheric. You may
neglect minor losses.

What is the total shear force?
What assumption did you make? (Check your
assumption!)

 34. Summary

 Navier-Stokes Equations  and the Continuity
  Equation describe complex flow including
  turbulence
 The Navier-Stokes Equations can be solved
  analytically for several simple flows
 Numerical solutions are required to describe
  turbulent flows
