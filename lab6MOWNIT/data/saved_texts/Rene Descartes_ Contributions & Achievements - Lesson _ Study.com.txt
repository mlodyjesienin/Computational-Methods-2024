Mathematical Achievements



Descartes made many lasting contributions in the field of mathematics. His most significant achievement was the use of algebraic formulas to describe geometric figures, which formed a branch of mathematics known as analytical geometry. Every high school student becomes familiar with Descartes' work as it was the foundation of the Cartesian coordinate system. The system relies on the use of an x-, y- and z-axes to graphically portray a 3-dimensional shape such as a cube, resulting from an algebraic formula. 
High school algebra students should also recognize some of Descartes' other achievements, such as standardized algebraic notation. For instance, it is very common to notate unknowns or variables in an equation with the letters x, y, and z. Constants in the equation are commonly represented with the letters a, b, and c. Therefore, in the equation F(x, y, z) = 2x + 3y + 4z, the value of F(x, y, z) is determined by three variables and three constants. The unknowns in the equation are x, y, and z. A more general way of formulating the equation using letter for constants would be: F(x, y, z) = ax + by + cz In this version of the equation, the numbers are replaced by the constants a, b, and c. Descartes used this notation and we have used it ever since. He was also responsible for developing standard notation for exponents. For example, any number (x) raised to its third power (that is x times x times x) is notated as x^3. Descartes' work had profound influence on Isaac Newton, who later helped to discover calculus.

Philosophical Achievements



Descartes is also regarded as the father of modern Western Philosophy. He adopted a radical skepticism, rejecting facts until he could be certain the facts were true. The Scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages made little distinction between theology and philosophy. But Descartes identified philosophy with the natural sciences, a sharp break from his predecessors. He set the stage for the future development of philosophy outside of the constraints of theology. In his book Rules for the Direction of the Mind written in 1629 but published posthumously in 1701, Descartes wrote his three rules for thinking: 
The validity of all true judgments depends on reason alone. 
Knowledge should be proven by the same rigor required in mathematics and geometry. 
The mind should not be bound by tradition or authority, only by what can be observed and deduced by reason.

Cogito, Ergo Sum



In his Meditations on First Philosophy written in 1641-1642, Descartes wrote what has become the most famous phrase in the history of philosophy: 'I think, therefore I am.' In this book, Descartes begins an epistemological inquiry into the very existence of reality. He questions how we can be sure we know anything for certain. Descartes compares his examination to someone who notices a rotten apple in a basket of apples. The rotten apple must be taken out so it will not contaminate all of the other apples. The owner of the basket then prudently removes the other apples to examine them one by one before returning them to the basket. Descartes aims to do this with all the facts he held to be true. One of the first questions Descartes asks is how he knows that he himself is real. He comes to the realization 'Cogito, Ergo Sum.' I think, therefore I am. This becomes the cornerstone for the rest of his epistemological work, which is the study of how we know what we know. He reasons to the existence of God, and further reasons God would not be a deceiver. If that is the case, we are entitled to believe in the existence of the world around us. This line of inquiry came under attack in successive generations, but no one has doubted the importance of his work on the future of philosophy.

Lesson Summary



Rene Descartes was a 17th century polymath, an achiever in multiple fields, who made tremendous contributions to the field of mathematics, such as providing a foundation for the Cartesian coordinate system, which relies on the use of x-, y-, and z-axes to graphically portray a 3-dimensional shape. His most important contribution was in the field of analytical geometry, which uses algebraic formulas to define geometric shapes. Descartes was also a rationalist philosopher who insisted on rigorous standards to prove the truth of any fact. In his Meditations on First Philosophy he wrote the most famous phrase in philosophy: 'I think, therefore I am.'
