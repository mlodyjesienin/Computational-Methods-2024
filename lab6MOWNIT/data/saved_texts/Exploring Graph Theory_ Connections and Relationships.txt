Introduction to Graph Theory
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of connections and relationships between objects or areas. It involves the analysis and representation of these connections using graphs, which consist of vertices (points) and edges (lines) that connect them.
Graph theory is an important topic in the AI HL course, specifically in the geometry and trigonometry section. This video aims to provide a high-level overview of graph theory and discuss common types of questions that students may encounter in an IB AI HL exam.
Understanding Graphs
Graph theory focuses on the connections between physical objects, which can be represented using graphs. These connections can be between towns, represented by vertices, and railway networks or office buildings, represented by edges. Graph theory can also be thought of as networking, which emphasizes the relationships between objects.
Terminology in Graph Theory
To understand graph theory, it is essential to familiarize oneself with the terminology used. In graphs, vertices represent towns or objects, while edges illustrate the connections between them. The degree of a vertex refers to the number of edges connected to it. Graphs can be classified as directed or undirected, depending on the presence or absence of arrows on the edges.
Weighted Graphs
Graphs can also be weighted, meaning that each edge carries a numerical value, such as time or distance. For example, in a railway network, the weight of an edge can represent the time it takes to travel between two towns. Understanding weighted graphs is crucial for analyzing optimal routes and making cost-effective decisions.
Connected Graphs
Connected graphs are graphs in which there is a path or route to traverse from any vertex to any other vertex. These graphs provide a continuous connection between all of their vertices. In contrast, disconnected graphs have at least one vertex that cannot be reached from or reach any other vertex.
Complete Graphs
A complete graph is a Type of graph in which every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex with a direct route. This means that for any two vertices, there is a direct edge connecting them. Complete graphs are useful in scenarios where direct routes are desired or essential.
Subgraphs
Subgraphs are smaller portions of the overall graph. They consist of a subset of the vertices and edges present in the original graph. These subgraphs can be isolated for analysis or focused study on specific areas of interest within the larger graph.
Types of Routes in Graph Theory
In graph theory, different types of routes are used to describe paths or cycles within a graph. These routes include walks, trails, paths, circuits, and cycles. Understanding these terms is crucial for interpreting and solving graph theory problems efficiently.
Adjacency Tables and Matrices
Adjacency tables and matrices are tools used to represent the connections between vertices and edges in a graph. These tables and matrices can be directed or undirected, as well as weighted or unweighted, depending on the nature of the graph. They provide a concise and organized way to analyze and manipulate graph data.
Minimum Spanning Trees
Minimum spanning trees are used to find the most cost-effective or efficient way to connect all vertices in a graph. They provide a subgraph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total weight or cost. Two commonly used algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees are Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.
Traversing Every Edge and Vertex
Traversing every edge in a graph without duplicating any edges is known as the Chinese Postman Problem. This problem aims to find the optimal route that covers all edges of a graph exactly once and returns to the starting point. On the other HAND, traversing every vertex without duplicating any vertices is called the Traveling Salesman Problem. The objective is to find the most efficient route that visits each vertex exactly once.

Introduction to Graph Theory
Graph theory is a fascinating area of mathematics that revolves around the study of connections and relationships between objects or areas. It is a crucial topic covered in the AI HL course, particularly in the geometry and trigonometry section. In this article, we will Delve into the world of graph theory, exploring its fundamental concepts and applications.
Understanding Graphs
At its Core, graph theory focuses on the connections between physical objects. These connections can be represented using graphs, which consist of vertices (also known as nodes) and edges. Vertices represent the objects or areas of interest, while edges depict the relationships or connections between them. Graphs can be used to analyze various scenarios, such as town networks, office buildings, or even social media connections.
Terminology in Graph Theory
To navigate the field of graph theory effectively, it is crucial to be familiar with its terminology. In a graph, vertices represent the objects or areas being studied, and edges represent the connections between them. The degree of a vertex refers to the number of edges that are connected to it. Graphs can be classified as either directed or undirected, depending on whether the edges have arrows indicating the direction of the connection.
Weighted Graphs
In some cases, the relationships between objects or areas are not equal or symmetrical. This is where weighted graphs come into play. Weighted graphs assign numerical values (weights) to the edges, reflecting the importance, cost, or distance associated with each connection. These weights can represent various parameters such as time, distance, or cost. Weighted graphs are commonly used to optimize routes, determine the most efficient connections, or analyze cost-efficient solutions.
Connected Graphs
Connected graphs play a vital role in graph theory as they represent scenarios where there is a continuous path between any pair of vertices. In other words, it is possible to traverse from any vertex to any other vertex within the graph. This connectivity allows for the exploration of relationships and interactions among the different objects or areas represented by the graph. Conversely, disconnected graphs consist of components or sections that are not connected to each other.
Complete Graphs
A complete graph is a special type of graph in which every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex. This means that, for any two vertices, there exists a direct edge connecting them. Complete graphs are often used to represent scenarios where direct connectivity between all objects or areas is desired. For example, they could model a fully interconnected telecommunication network or a comprehensive transport system.
Subgraphs
In complex graphs, it is sometimes necessary to focus on specific subsets of vertices and edges. Subgraphs allow us to isolate a smaller portion of the overall graph and analyze it independently. By examining subgraphs, researchers can gain insights into specific relationships or study localized phenomena within the broader graph.
Types of Routes in Graph Theory
Graph theory encompasses various types of routes that describe different types of paths or cycles within a graph. These include walks, trails, paths, circuits, and cycles. A walk refers to a sequence of edges and vertices that may repeat. A trail is a walk that does not repeat edges, while a path is a trail that does not repeat vertices. Circuits are closed walks in which the start and end vertices coincide. Finally, cycles are circuits that do not have repeated vertices, except for the start and end vertex.
Adjacency Tables and Matrices
To analyze and represent the connections within a graph, mathematicians often use adjacency tables and matrices. These tools offer a convenient and structured approach to organizing and manipulating graph data. An adjacency table provides a concise representation of the relationships between vertices and edges, while an adjacency matrix condenses this information into a matrix format. These tables and matrices can be directed or undirected, as well as weighted or unweighted, depending on the graph's characteristics.
Minimum Spanning Trees
The concept of minimum spanning trees is central to graph theory, particularly in scenarios where a cost-effective or efficient connection between multiple vertices is desired. A minimum spanning tree is a subgraph that connects all vertices with the minimum possible total weight or cost. It represents the most optimized way to ensure connectivity while minimizing resources used. Two popular algorithms, Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm, are often employed to determine the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
Traversing Every Edge and Vertex
Two interesting problems that arise in graph theory are traversing every edge and vertex in a graph without duplicating any edges or vertices. The Chinese Postman Problem focuses on finding an optimal route that covers every edge in a graph exactly once, returning to the starting point. This problem is particularly Relevant in scenarios such as delivering mail to all houses in a city. On the other hand, the Traveling Salesman Problem involves finding the most efficient route that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once, regardless of duplication of edges. This problem is often encountered in optimizing sales routes or planning efficient travel itineraries.
