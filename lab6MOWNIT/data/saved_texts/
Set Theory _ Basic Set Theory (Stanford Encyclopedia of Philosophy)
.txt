Supplement to Set Theory


Basic Set Theory

Sets are well-determined collections that are completely characterized
by their elements. Thus, two sets are equal if and only if they have
exactly the same elements. The basic relation in set theory is that of
elementhood, or membership. We write \(a\in A\) to indicate that the
object \(a\) is an element, or a member, of the set
\(A\). We also say that \(a\) belongs to \(A\). Thus, a set
\(A\) is equal to a set \(B\) if and only if for every \(a\), \(a\in
A\) if and only if \(a\in B\). In particular, there is only one set
with no elements at all. This set is called, naturally, the empty
set, and is represented by the symbol \({\varnothing}\).

We say that \(A\) is a subset of \(B\), written \(A\subseteq
B\), if every element of \(A\) is an element of \(B\). Thus, \(A=B\)
if and only if \(A\subseteq B\) and \(B\subseteq A\). Notice that
\({\varnothing}\subseteq A\), for every set \(A\).

Given sets \(A\) and \(B\), one can perform some basic operations with
them yielding the following sets:



The set \(A\cup B\), called the union of \(A\) and \(B\),
whose elements are the elements of \(A\) and the elements of
\(B\).


The set \(A\cap B\), called the intersection of \(A\) and
\(B\), whose elements are the elements common to \(A\) and
\(B\).


The set \(A-B\), called the difference of \(A\) and \(B\),
whose elements are those elements of \(A\) that are not members of
\(B\).


It is routine to check that those operations satisfy the following
properties:



Associativity:



\(A \cup (B\cup C)=(A\cup B)\cup C\)


\(A \cap (B\cap C)=(A\cap B)\cap C\)



Commutativity:



\(A \cup B=B\cup A\)


\(A \cap B=B\cap A\)



Distributivity:



\(A \cup (B\cap C)=(A\cup B)\cap (A\cup C)\)


\(A \cap (B\cup C)=(A\cap B)\cup (A\cap C)\)



Idempotency:



\(A \cup A=A\)


\(A \cap A=A\)





\(A \cup {\varnothing}=A\)


\(A\cap {\varnothing}={\varnothing}\)


\(A - A={\varnothing}\)



If \(A\subseteq B\), then



\(A\cup B=A\cup (B-A)=B\)


\(A \cap B=A\)



Given an object \(a\) we can form the set that has \(a\) as its only
element. This set is denoted by \(\{ a \}\). More generally, given
\(a,b,c,\ldots\), we can form the set having \(a,b,c,\ldots\) as its
elements, which we denote by \(\{ a,b,c, \ldots\}\). Of course, we can
actually write down all the elements of the set when there are not too
many of them. In the case of infinite sets this is clearly not
possible.

If \(a=b\), then \(\{ a,b\}=\{ a\}\). Also, for any \(a\) and \(b\),
the pair \(\{ a,b\}\) is the same as the pair \(\{ b,a\}\). So, if we
wish to take into account the order in which the two elements of a
pair are given, we need to find another way of representing the pair.
Thus, we define the ordered pair \((a,b)\) as the set \(\{ \{
a\},\{ a,b\}\}\). One can easily check that two ordered pairs
\((a,b)\) and \((c,d)\) are equal if and only if \(a=c\) and \(b=d\).
The order is now important, for if \(a\ne b\), then \((a,b)\ne
(b,a)\).

The Cartesian product \(A\times B\) of two sets, \(A\) and
\(B\), is defined as the set of all ordered pairs \((a,b)\) such that
\(a\in A\) and \(b\in B\).

Having defined ordered pairs, one can now define ordered
triples \((a,b,c)\) as \((a,(b,c))\), or in general ordered
\(n\)-tuples \((a_1,\ldots ,a_n)\) as \((a_1, (a_2,\ldots
,a_n))\).

The Cartesian product \(A_1 \times \ldots \times A_n\), of the sets
\(A_1,\ldots , A_n\) is the set of all \(n\)-tuples \((a_1,\ldots
,a_n)\) such that \(a_i \in A_i\), for every \(1\leq i\leq n\). In
particular, for \(n\geq 2\), the \(n\)-times Cartesian product of a
set \(A\), denoted by \(A^n\), is the set of all \(n\)-tuples of
elements of \(A\).

1. Relations

A binary relation on a set \(A\) is a set of ordered pairs of
elements of \(A\), that is, a subset of \(A\times A\). In general, an
\(n\)-ary relation on \(A\) is a subset of \(A^n\).

A binary relation \(R\) on a set \(A\) is called reflexive if
\((a,a)\in R\) for every \(a\in A\). It is called symmetric
if \((b,a)\in R\) whenever \((a,b)\in R\). And it is called
transitive if \((a,c)\in R\) whenever \((a,b)\in R\) and
\((b,c)\in R\). A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and
transitive is called an equivalence relation. The identity
relation on any set \(A\) is the paradigmatic example of an
equivalence relation. Another example is the relation on the set of
all finite sets of natural numbers consisting of all the pairs
\((a,b)\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) have the same number of
elements.

If \(R\) is an equivalence relation on a set \(A\), and \((a,b)\in
R\), then we say that that \(a\) and \(b\) are
\(R\)-equivalent. For every \(a\in A\), the equivalence
class of \(a\), usually denoted by \([a]_R\), is the set of all
elements of \(A\) that are \(R\)-equivalent to \(a\). The set of all
\(R\)-equivalence classes is called the quotient set and is
denoted by \(A/R\). One can easily check that \(A/R\) is a
partition of \(A\), that is, no element of \(A/R\) is empty,
any two elements of \(A/R\) are disjoint, and every \(a\in A\) belongs
to (exactly) one element of \(A/R\), namely the class \([a]_R\).

If \(R\) is a binary relation, then one usually writes \(aRb\) instead
of \((a,b)\in R\).

A binary relation \(R\) on a set \(A\) is called
antisymmetric if \(a=b\) whenever \(aRb\) and \(bRa\). A
relation \(R\) on a set \(A\) that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and
transitive, is called a (reflexive) partial order. If we
remove from \(R\) all pairs \((a,a)\), for every \(a\in A\), then we
get a strict partial order. The \(\subseteq\) relation on any
set of sets is an example of a partial order. A partial order on a
given set \(A\) is usually represented by the symbol \(\leq\), and the
corresponding strict partial ordering by \(<\). A partial order
\(\leq\) on a set \(A\) with the additional property that either
\(a\leq b\) or \(b\leq a\), for all elements \(a\) and \(b\) of \(A\),
is called a total order, or a linear order. The
usual orderings of the set \(\mathbb{N}\) of natural numbers, the set
\(\mathbb{Z}\) of the integers, the set \(\mathbb{Q}\) of the rational
numbers, or the set \(\mathbb{R}\) of real numbers, are linear
orders.

Notice that if \(\leq\) is a linear order on a set \(A\), and
\(B\subseteq A\), then \(\leq \cap \, B^2\) is also a linear order on
\(B\). If \(\leq\) is a linear order on a set \(A\), then we say that
\(a\in A\) is the \(\leq\)-least element of \(A\) if there is no
\(b\in A\) distinct from \(a\) such that \(b\leq a\). The number \(0\)
is the least element of \(\mathbb{N}\), but \(\mathbb{Z}\) has no
least element.

A linear order \(\leq\) on a set \(A\) is a well-order if
every non-empty subset of \(A\) has a \(\leq\)-least element.
Equivalently, if there is no infinite strictly descending sequence

\[\ldots < a_2< a_1< a_0\]
 of elements of \(A\). Thus, the usual ordering of
\(\mathbb{N}\) is a well-order. But the usual order on \(\mathbb{Z}\)
is not, because it has no least element.
2. Functions

A (\(1\)-ary) function on a set \(A\) is a binary relation
\(F\) on \(A\) such that for every \(a\in A\) there is exactly one
pair \((a,b)\in F\). The element \(b\) is called the value of
\(F\) on \(a\), and is denoted by \(F(a)\). And the set \(A\) is
called the domain of \(F\). The notation \(F:A\to B\)
indicates that \(F\) is a function with domain \(A\) and values in the
set \(B\). For \(n\geq 2\), an \(n\)-ary function on \(A\) is
a function \(F:A^n\to B\), for some \(B\).

A function \(F:A\to B\) is one-to-one if for all elements
\(a\) and \(b\) of \(A\), if \(a\ne b\), then \(F(a)\ne F(b)\). And is
onto if for every \(b\in B\) there is some \(a\in A\) such
that \(F(a)=b\). Finally, \(F\) is bijective if it is
one-to-one and onto. Thus, a bijection \(F:A\to B\) establishes a
one-to-one correspondence between the elements of \(A\) and those of
\(B\), and \(A\) is bijectable with \(B\) if there is such a
bijection. The identity function on a set \(A\), denoted by
\(Id:A\to A\), and which consists of all the pairs \((a,a)\), with
\(a\in A\), is trivially a bijection.

Given functions \(F:A\to B\) and \(G:B\to C\), the composition of
\(F\) and \(G\), written \(G\circ F\), is the function \(G\circ
F:A\to C\) whose elements are all pairs \((a,G(F(a)))\), where \(a\in
A\). If \(F\) and \(G\) are bijections, then so is \(G\circ F\).
3. Sets and formulas

The formal language of set theory is the first-order language
whose only non-logical symbol is the binary relation symbol
\(\in\).

Given any formula \(\varphi(x,y_1,\ldots ,y_n)\) of the language of
set theory, and sets \(A,B_1,\ldots ,B_n\), one can form the set of
all those elements of \(A\) that satisfy the formula
\(\varphi(x,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\). This set is denoted by \(\{ a\in A:
\varphi(a,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\}\). The following are some examples



\({\varnothing}=\{ a\in A: \neg a= a\}\)


\(A=\{ a\in A: a=a\}\)


\(A-B=\{ a\in A: \neg a \in B\}\).


\(A\cap B=\{ a\in A: a\in B\}\).


And if \(B\) and \(C\) are subsets of \(A\), then



\(B\cup C=\{ a\in A: a\in B \vee a\in C\}\).


Given a subset \(C\subseteq A\times B\), the projection of
\(C\) (on the first coordinate) is the set


\(\{ a\in A: \exists b\in B ((a,b)\in C)\}\).


It is not the case, however, that given any formula
\(\varphi(x,y_1,\ldots ,y_n)\), and sets \(B_1,\ldots ,B_n\), one can
form the set of all those sets that satisfy the formula
\(\varphi(x,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\). For let \(\varphi(x)\) be the formula
\(\neg x \in x\). If \(A\) were the set of all sets that satisfy the
formula, then \(A\in A\) if and only if \(\neg A \in A\). A
contradiction! This contradiction is known as Russell’s
paradox, after Bertrand Russell, who discovered it in 1901 (see
the entry on
 Russell’s paradox).
4. Ordinals

The first ordinal number is \({\varnothing}\). Given an ordinal
\(\alpha\), the next bigger ordinal, called the (immediate)
successor of \(\alpha\), is the set \(\alpha \cup \{ \alpha
\}\). Thus, the successor of \(\alpha\) is just the set \(\alpha\)
together with one more element, namely, \(\alpha\) itself. The
finite ordinal numbers are those obtained by starting with
\({\varnothing}\) and repeatedly taking the successor.

In set theory the natural numbers are defined as the finite
ordinals. Thus,



\(0= {\varnothing}\)


\(1= {\varnothing}\cup \{ {\varnothing}\}=\{
{\varnothing}\}\)


\(2= \{ {\varnothing}\} \cup \{\{{\varnothing}\}\}=\{ {\varnothing},
\{ {\varnothing}\}\}\)


\(3= \{ {\varnothing}, \{ {\varnothing}\}\}\cup \{ \{ {\varnothing},
\{ {\varnothing}\}\}\} =\{ {\varnothing}, \{ {\varnothing}\}, \{
{\varnothing}, \{ {\varnothing}\}\}\}\)


\(\vdots\)


Notice that \(1=\{ 0\}\), \(2=\{ 0,1\}\), \(3=\{ 0,1,2\}\), and in
general we have \(n=\{ 0,1,2,\ldots ,n-1\}\). So, every natural number
\(n\) is just the set of its predecessors.

A set \(A\) is finite if there is a one-to-one correspondence
between some natural number \(n\) and the elements of \(A\), i.e., a
bijection \(F:n\to A\), in which case we say that \(A\) has \(n\)
elements. A set is infinite if it is not finite.

The set of all finite ordinals is denoted by the Greek letter omega
(\(\omega\)). Thus, \(\omega\) is just the set \(\mathbb{N}\) of
natural numbers. \(\omega\) is also an ordinal, the first infinite
ordinal. Notice that \(\omega\) is not the successor of any ordinal,
and so it is called a limit ordinal. Once we have \(\omega\)
we can continue generating more ordinals by taking its successor
\(\omega \cup \{ \omega \}\), then its successor \((\omega \cup
\{\omega\}) \cup \{\omega \cup \{\omega \}\}\), and so on. All ordinal
numbers greater than \(0\) are produced in this way, namely, either by
taking the successor of the last produced ordinal, or, if there is no
such last ordinal, by taking the set of all the ordinals produced so
far, as in the case of \(\omega\) which yields a new limit ordinal.
Note, however, that one cannot take the set of all ordinals,
for then this set would be a new limit ordinal, which is impossible,
since we already had them all.

As with finite ordinals, every infinite ordinal is just the set of its
predecessors. One consequence of this is that the \(\in\) relation is
a strict well-order on any set of ordinals. Thus, for any ordinals
\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) we define \(\alpha <\beta\) if and only if
\(\alpha \in \beta\). Then the associated reflexive well-order is
defined as \(\alpha \leq \beta\) if and only if \(\alpha <\beta\)
or \(\alpha =\beta\). Let us now observe that \(\alpha \subseteq
\beta\) if and only if \(\alpha \leq \beta\).
5. Countable and uncountable sets

If \(A\) is a finite set, there is a bijection \(F:n\to A\) between a
natural number \(n\) and \(A\). Any such bijection gives a
counting of the elements of \(A\), namely, \(F(0)\) is the
first element of \(A\), \(F(1)\) is the second, and so on. Thus, all
finite sets are countable. An infinite set \(A\) is called
countable if there is a bijection \(F:\omega \to A\) between
the set of natural numbers and \(A\). The set \(\mathbb{N}\) of
natural numbers is (trivially) countable. If \(A\) is an infinite
subset of \(\omega\), then \(A\) is also countable: for let \(F:\omega
\to A\) be such that \(F(n)\) is the least element of \(A\) that is
not in the set \(\{ F(m)\in A: m< n\}\). Then \(F\) is a
bijection.

Every infinite subset of a countable set is also countable: for
suppose \(F:\omega \to A\) is a bijection and \(B\subseteq A\) is
infinite. Then the set \(\{ n\in \omega: F(n)\in B\}\) is an infinite
subset of \(\omega\), hence countable, and so there is a bijection
\(G:\omega \to \{ n\in \omega : F(n)\in B\}\). Then the composition
function \(F\circ G:\omega \to B\) is a bijection.

The union of a countable set and a finite set is also countable. For
given sets \(A\) and \(B\), which without loss of generality we may
assume they are disjoint, and given bijections \(F:\omega \to A\) and
\(G:n\to B\), for some \(n<\omega\), let \(H:\omega \to A\cup B\)
be the bijection given by: \(H(m)=G(m)\), for every \(m<n\), and
\(H(m)=F(m-n)\), for every \(n\leq m\).

Moreover, the union of two countable sets is also countable: since we
have already shown that the union of a countable set and a finite set
is also countable, it is enough to see that the union of two disjoint
countable sets is also countable. So, suppose \(A\) and \(B\) are
countable sets and \(F:\omega \to A\) and \(G:\omega \to B\) are
bijections, then the function \(H:\omega \to A\cup B\) consisting of
all pairs \((2n,F(n))\), plus all pairs \((2n+1, G(n))\) is a
bijection.

Thus, the set \(\mathbb{Z}\), being the union of two countable sets,
namely 
\[\mathbb{N}\cup \{ -1,-2,-3,-4,\ldots \}\]
 is also countable.

The Cartesian product of two infinite countable sets is also
countable. For suppose \(F:\omega \to A\) and \(G:\omega \to B\) are
bijections. Then, using the fact that the function \(J:\omega \times
\omega \to \omega\) given by \(J((m,n))= 2^m(2n+1)-1\) is a bijection,
one has that the function \(H:\omega \to A\times B\) given by
\(H(2^m(2n+1)-1)=(F(m),G(n))\) is also a bijection.

Since any rational number is given by a pair of integers, i.e., a
quotient \(\frac{m}{n}\), where \(m,n\in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(n\ne 0\),
the set \(\mathbb{Q}\) of rational numbers is also countable.

However, Georg Cantor discovered that the set \(\mathbb{R}\) of real
numbers is not countable. For suppose, aiming for a contradiction,
that \(F:\omega \to \mathbb{R}\) is a bijection. Let \(a_0=F(0)\).
Choose the least \(k\) such that \(a_0<F(k)\) and put \(b_0=F(k)\).
Given \(a_n\) and \(b_n\), choose the least \(l\) such that
\(a_n<F(l)<b_n\), and put \(a_{n+1}=F(l)\). And choose the least
\(m\) such that \(a_{n+1}<F(m)<b_n\), and put \(b_{n+1}=F(m)\).
Thus, we have \(a_0<a_1<a_2<\cdots\) \(\cdots
<b_2<b_1<b_0\). Now let \(a\) be the limit of the \(a_n\).
Then \(a\) is a real number different from \(F(n)\), all \(n\), which
is impossible because \(F\) is a bijection.

The existence of uncountable sets follows from a much more general
fact, also discovered by Cantor. Namely, given any set \(A\), the set
of all its subsets, called the power set of \(A\), and
denoted by \(\mathcal{P}(A)\), is not bijectable with \(A\): for
suppose that \(F:A\to \mathcal{P}(A)\) is a bijection. Then the subset
\(\{ a\in A: \neg a \in F(a)\}\) of \(A\) is the value \(F(a)\) of
some \(a\in A\). But then \(a\in F(a)\) if and only if \(\neg a \in
F(a)\). Hence, if \(A\) is any infinite set, then \(\mathcal{P}(A)\)
is uncountable.

There are also uncountable ordinals. The set of all finite and
countable ordinals is also an ordinal, called \(\omega_1\), and is the
first uncountable ordinal. Similarly, the set of all ordinals that are
bijectable with some ordinal less than or equal to \(\omega_1\) is
also an ordinal, called \(\omega_2\), and is not bijectable with
\(\omega_1\), and so on.
5.1 Cardinals

The cardinality, or size, of a finite set \(A\) is the unique
natural number \(n\) such that there is a bijection \(F:n\to A\).

In the case of infinite sets, their cardinality is given, not by a
natural number, but by an infinite ordinal. However, in contrast with
the finite sets, an infinite set \(A\) is bijectable with many
different ordinal numbers. For example, the set \(\mathbb{N}\) is
bijectable with \(\omega\), but also with it successor \(\omega \cup
\{\omega\}\): by assigning \(0\) to \(\omega\) and \(n+1\) to \(n\),
for all \(n\in \omega\), we obtain a bijection between \(\omega \cup
\{\omega \}\) and \(\omega\). But since the ordinals are well-ordered,
we may define the cardinality of an infinite set as the least ordinal
that is bijectable with it.

In particular, the cardinality of an ordinal number \(\alpha\) is the
least ordinal \(\kappa\) that is bijectable with it. Notice that
\(\kappa\) is not bijectable with any smaller ordinal, for otherwise
so would be \(\alpha\). The ordinal numbers that are not bijectable
with any smaller ordinal are called cardinal numbers. Thus,
all natural numbers are cardinals, and so are \(\omega\),
\(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), and so on. In general, given any cardinal
\(\kappa\), the set of all ordinals that are bijectable with some
ordinal \(\leq \kappa\) is also a cardinal; it is the smallest
cardinal bigger than \(\kappa\).

The infinite cardinals are represented by the letter aleph
(\(\aleph\)) of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus, the smallest infinite
cardinal is \(\omega =\aleph_0\), the next one is
\(\omega_1=\aleph_1\), which is the first uncountable cardinal, then
comes \(\omega_2=\aleph_2\), etc.

The cardinality of any set \(A\), denoted by \(|A|\), is the unique
cardinal number that is bijectable with \(A\). We saw already that
\(|\mathbb{R}|\) is uncountable, hence greater than \(\aleph_0\), but
it is not known what cardinal number it is. The conjecture that
\(|\mathbb{R}|=\aleph_1\), formulated by Cantor in 1878, is the famous
Continuum Hypothesis.
