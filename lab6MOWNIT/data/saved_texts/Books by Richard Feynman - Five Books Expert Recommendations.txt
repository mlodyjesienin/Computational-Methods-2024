Books by Richard Feynman
Richard Feynman was an American physicist who won the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics.
“Richard Feynman is probably the greatest American postwar physicist. He worked on the atomic bomb in his 20s and he got the Nobel Prize…His wife died of tuberculosis when they were at Los Alamos building the bomb and he decided you could go one of two ways. You could either say, “I’m going to be totally depressed for the rest of my life,” or, “I’m going to enjoy myself.”” Marcus Chown, a student of Feynman, discussing the best books on Cosmology.
For a biography of Richard Feynman, astronomy professor Andrew Lawrence recommends Quantum Man. “It is very straightforward and beautifully written. If you want to know what it is like inside the skull of a physicist it is a very good book to read.”

Six Easy Pieces

by Richard Feynman
Read expert recommendations





    								“Feynman could write about difficult physics and teach it in a way that no one else could. He is widely regarded as one of the best physics teachers of all time. His discussions of Newtonian gravitation and how we came to it, phenomena like tides, and how you can measure the speed of light by observing Jupiter’s moons are described with such humour and clarity. He conveys the excitement of physics”    								Read more...

Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman! Adventures of a Curious Character

by Richard Feynman
Read expert recommendations





    								“Everyone should read this book, because it gets across why a subject like physics is so enjoyable. Physics is not just about sticky tape and rolling balls down hills and springs and batteries and ripple tanks—the sort of physics that a lot of people remember from school and may have turned them off the subject because they think it’s dry and boring.

A book like Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman! gives you the joy of discovery. Feynman is the most colourful character in physics and he just showed what an incredible adventure science was and is. He just makes you think: ‘Wow! How can the world be like that?! Wait until I tell everyone! I mean, you think the paranormal is amazing – let me tell you about quantum mechanics!’

QED

by Richard Feynman
Read expert recommendations





    								“When Feynman was at Cal Tech, this wealthy couple who’d grown up in the same New York neighbourhood as he had said, “Look, you’ve won this Nobel Prize, now explain to ordinary people what for.” And Feynman said, “No, it’s too complicated.” But eventually he did this series of public lectures, and that was the book. It’s a tiny book and in it he describes the whole of quantum electrodynamics without a single equation.”    								Read more...

The Best Physics Books for Teenagers, recommended by Kate Lee

What are the best books for getting a teenager into physics? Kate Lee, a physics teacher at St Paul’s Girls School, recommends books about NASA, space travel, and the Big Bang—and puzzles over the question of why it is so hard for young women to stay in physics as a profession.
