The Mathematical challenges in AI seminar is the successor of MLWM. 

The main focus of the seminars this year will be to explore the mathematical problems that arise in modern machine learning. For example, we aim to cover:
 
1) Mathematical problems (e.g. in linear algebra and probability theory) whose resolution would assist the design, implementation and understanding of current AI models.
 
2) Mathematical problems or results resulting from interpretability of ML models. 

3) Mathematical questions posing challenges for AI systems.
 
Our aim is to attract interested mathematicians to what we see as a fascinating and important source of new research directions.

The seminar is an initiative of the Sydney Mathematical Research Institute (SMRI).
