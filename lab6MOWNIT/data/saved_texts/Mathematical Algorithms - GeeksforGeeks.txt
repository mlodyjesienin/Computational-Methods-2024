Conditional Probability Conditional probability P(A | B) indicates the probability of even 'A' happening given that the even B happened.[Tex]P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} [/Tex]We can easily understand above formula using below diagram. Since B has already happened, the sample space reduces to B. So the probability of A happening becomes P(A ? B
