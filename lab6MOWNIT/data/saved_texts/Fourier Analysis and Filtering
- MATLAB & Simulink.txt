Fourier Analysis and FilteringFourier transforms, convolution, digital filtering


Transforms and filters are tools for processing and analyzing discrete data, and are
     commonly used in signal processing applications and computational mathematics. When data is
     represented as a function of time or space, the Fourier transform decomposes the data into
     frequency components. The fft function uses a fast Fourier transform
     algorithm that reduces its computational cost compared to other direct implementations. For a
     more detailed introduction to Fourier analysis, see Fourier Transforms. The conv and filter functions are also useful tools for modifying the amplitude or phase of
     input data using a transfer function.
