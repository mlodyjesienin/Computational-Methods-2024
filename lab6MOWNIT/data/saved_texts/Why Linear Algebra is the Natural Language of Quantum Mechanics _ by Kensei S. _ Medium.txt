However, not only is the physics quite bizarre, I believe the math is too when you first learn it. While in most other field of physics, the connection between the physics and the mathematics used tends to be relatively clear, when it comes quantum mechanics the connection is really not obvious. How can an area about abstract vector spaces and matrices have anything to do with the probabilistic…----1FollowWritten by Kensei S.1.1K FollowersStudent with an interest in mathematics and physicsFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams
