represent theories and analyse problems in economics.Mathematics allows for the formulation of theoretical relationships with rigor,
generality, and simplicity. Mathematics allows economists to form meaningful,
testable propositions about wide-ranging and complex subjects which could less
easily be expressed informally. Further, the language of mathematics allows
economists to make specific, positive claims about controversial or contentious
subjects that would be impossible without mathematics. Much of economic
theory is currently presented in terms of mathematical economic models, a set
of stylized and simplified mathematical relationships asserted to clarify
assumptions and implications.Broad applications include: optimization problems as to goal equilibrium, whether of a household,
    business firm, or policy maker
 static (or equilibrium) analysis in which the economic unit (such as a
    household) or economic system (such as a market or the economy) is
    modelled as not changing
 comparative statics as to a change from one equilibrium to another
    induced by a change in one or more factors
 dynamic analysis, tracing changes in an economic system over time, for
    example from economic growth.Formal economic modeling began in the 19th century with the use of
differential calculus to represent and explain economic behaviour, such as utility
maximization, an early economic application of mathematical optimization.
Economics became more mathematical as a discipline throughout the first half
of the 20th century, but introduction of new and generalized techniques in the
period around the Second World War, as in game theory, had greatly broaden
the use of mathematical formulations in economics.This rapid systematizing of economics alarmed critics of the discipline as well
as some noted economists. John Maynard Keynes, Robert Heilbroner, Friedrich
Hayek and others have criticized the broad use of mathematical models for
human behaviour, arguing that some human choices are irreducible to
mathematics.From the later-1930s, an array of new mathematical tools from the differential
calculus and differential equations, convex sets, and graph theory weredeployed to advance economic theory in a way similar to new mathematical
methods earlier applied to physics.The following mathematical tools are widely used in Economics-
Differential calculus- used for finding MR, MC, MP etc.
Linear models – Von Neumann’s models of general equilibrium use linear
models
Input – Output Model makes use of mathematical concepts(Wassily
Leontief)
Mathematical optimization – Widely used in micro-economics. Eg:
expenditure minimisation, utility maximisation etc.
Linear Programming- Helps in the allocation of resources in firms and in
industries.
Non-linear programming- Helps in the planning of production schedules for
factories.
