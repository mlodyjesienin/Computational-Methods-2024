Infinity: The word itself belies the immensity of the concept that philosophers, mathematicians, theologians, and physicists have grappled with for thousands of years. Just putting a name to infinity seems to limit it in some way. But on Friday night at the World Science Festival in New York, a panel of experts nonetheless tried to grapple with this slippery concept.
Philosopher's Paradoxes
Philip Clayton, philosopher, theologian, and dean of the Claremont School of Theology in California, compared infinity to looking up at the stars in the night sky or watching grains of sand slide through your fingers. He said that the Greek philosopher who first introduced the concept of infinity was Zeno of Elea in the 400s B.C. "Zeno found that whenever he introduced real infinities into the world, he ran into paradoxes," Clayton said. Zeno famously used an example of a footrace between Achilles and a tortoise: If the tortoise was given a head start and Achilles had to catch up to it, he would make it halfway from where he started to where the tortoise was, and halfway from that point to the tortoise, and so on. Zeno argued that if infinities did exist, Achilles would never catch up to the tortoise; he would simply continue to close the distance in half.
Aristotle also decided that there could be no actual infinities if he were to do good science. " Start counting upward," Clayton said. "You can go as long as you want to, but in a finite period of time, you'll only make it a finite distance."
Different Infinities
While Aristotle and Zeno helped to mold philosophers' understanding of infinity, Georg Cantor was the hero for the mathematicians. Cantor's biggest insight into set theory, or the mathematical science of the infinite, was that there are different kinds of infinity. "Some infinities can actually be bigger than others," said Steven Strogatz, mathematics professor at Cornell University.
How can this be? Cantor distinguished between different levels of infinities, countable and uncountable. A countable infinity, the lowest level, is a set of natural numbers, which begins 1,2,3, and continues on indefinitely. You can count the numbers but you'll never reach the end. By contrast, uncountable infinities, the higher levels, are sets of real numbers, which can include irrational numbers, fractions, and decimal places. Cantor also hypothesized that there was no other level of real numbers, sandwiched between the countable and uncountable levels. He named this hypothesis the continuum hypothesis, because real numbers represent a linear continuum. Austrian mathematician Kurt Gödel proved in 1940 that Cantor's continuum hypothesis could not be proved false. Yet in 1963, Paul Cohen, an American mathematician, showed that you could not prove it to be true, either. This led mathematicians to describe the continuum hypothesis as "provably unsolvable."
William Hugh Woodin, a set theorist at the University of California, Berkeley, and another speaker at the event, has spent his life trying to solve it. "Really, the fundamental question is this," Woodin said. "We have this conception of mathematical infinity and it's embodied in our conception of the universe of sets. Now, that's a human creation. Maybe there's no there or there. Maybe there's no up. It's just entirely an extrapolation of the world around us into a realm where there is no truth."
Woodin said he began his career thinking that the continuum hypothesis was true, but over time he shifted to thinking that it is false. "When you work on a problem that can't be solved, you're allowed to change your mind," he said. "There's no computer that you can build that can give you the answer to the continuum hypothesis."
Does it Matter?
Raphael Bousso, a physics professor at Berkeley, said that despite its ephemeral nature, the concept of infinity has real implications on humanity's understanding of the universe. Sometimes, though, it's best just leaving the question of infinity to the side for practicality's sake. Consider eternal inflation, which states that the universe is expanding at an exponential rate. As such, we will never be able to see the entire universe because it is expanding too fast for light to catch up to it. On a practical level, then, "we don't need to know whether space is finite or infinite," Bousso said.
These four experts agreed that understanding infinity comes down to comprehending the concept and the cognitive style of humans and the way we interact. "Infinity is not only beautiful, it's simple," Strogatz said. "Which may come as a surprise to our audience."Watch Next Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowScienceEvery Single Cell in Your Body Could Be ConsciousSupercapacitors: New Kings of Power?How to Live Forever, or Die TryingHow to Live Forever, or Die TryingAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowExperts Translate Papyrus About Jesus’ ChildhoodAncient Roman Room Shows Rare Blue WallsStudy Find Giant Viruses on Greenland Ice SheetDinosaur Fan Discovers Teen T.
