Renditions of the Elements of EuclidIn ancient times, commentaries were written by Heron of Alexandria (flourished 62 ce), Pappus of Alexandria (flourished c. 320 ce), Proclus, and Simplicius of Cilicia (flourished c. 530 ce). The father of Hypatia, Theon of Alexandria (c. 335–405 ce), edited the Elements with textual changes and some additions; his version quickly drove other editions out of existence, and it remained the Greek source for all subsequent Arabic and Latin translations until 1808, when an earlier edition was discovered in the Vatican. The immense impact of the Elements on Islamic mathematics is visible through the many translations into Arabic from the 9th century forward, three of which must be mentioned: two by al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ibn Maṭar, first for the ʿAbbāsid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (ruled 786–809) and again for the caliph al-Maʾmūn (ruled 813–833); and a third by Isḥāq ibn Ḥunayn (died 910), son of Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq (808–873), which was revised by Thābit ibn Qurrah (c. 836–901) and again by Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (1201–74). Euclid first became known in Europe through Latin translations of these versions. The first extant Latin translation of the Elements was made about 1120 by Adelard of Bath, who obtained a copy of an Arabic version in Spain, where he traveled while disguised as a Muslim student. Adelard also composed an abridged version and an edition with commentary, thus starting a Euclidean tradition of the greatest importance until the Renaissance unearthed Greek manuscripts. Incontestably the best Latin translation from Arabic was made by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114–87) from the Isḥāq-Thābit versions. The first direct translation from the Greek without an Arabic intermediary was made by Bartolomeo Zamberti and published in Vienna in Latin in 1505, and the editio princeps of the Greek text was published in Basel in 1533 by Simon Grynaeus. The first English translation of the Elements was by Sir Henry Billingsley in 1570. The impact of this activity on European mathematics cannot be exaggerated; the ideas and methods of Kepler, Pierre de Fermat (1601–65), René Descartes (1596–1650), and Isaac Newton (1642 [Old Style]–1727) were deeply rooted in, and inconceivable without, Euclid’s Elements. Other writings The Euclidean corpus falls into two groups: elementary geometry and general mathematics. Although many of Euclid’s writings were translated into Arabic in medieval times, works from both groups have vanished. Extant in the first group is the Data (from the first Greek word in the book, dedomena [“given”]), a disparate collection of 94 advanced geometric propositions that all take the following form: given some item or property, then other items or properties are also “given”—that is, they can be determined. Some of the propositions can be viewed as geometry exercises to determine if a figure is constructible by Euclidean means. On Divisions (of figures)—restored and edited in 1915 from extant Arabic and Latin versions—deals with problems of dividing a given figure by one or more straight lines into various ratios to one another or to other given areas. Four lost works in geometry are described in Greek sources and attributed to Euclid. The purpose of the Pseudaria (“Fallacies”), says Proclus, was to distinguish and to warn beginners against different types of fallacies to which they might be susceptible in geometrical reasoning. According to Pappus, the Porisms (“Corollaries”), in three books, contained 171 propositions. Michel Chasles (1793–1880) conjectured that the work contained propositions belonging to the modern theory of transversals and to projective geometry. Like the fate of earlier “Elements,” Euclid’s Conics, in four books, was supplanted by a more thorough book on the conic sections with the same title written by Apollonius of Perga (c. 262–190 bce). Pappus also mentioned the Surface-loci (in two books), whose subject can only be inferred from the title. Among Euclid’s extant works are the Optics, the first Greek treatise on perspective, and the Phaenomena, an introduction to mathematical astronomy. Those works are part of a corpus known as “the Little Astronomy” that also includes the Moving Sphere by Autolycus of Pitane. Two treatises on music, the “Division of the Scale” (a basically Pythagorean theory of music) and the “Introduction to Harmony,” were once mistakenly thought to be from The Elements of Music, a lost work attributed by Proclus to Euclid. Legacy Almost from the time of its writing, the Elements exerted a continuous and major influence on human affairs. It was the primary source of geometric reasoning, theorems, and methods at least until the advent of non-Euclidean geometry in the 19th century. It is sometimes said that, other than the Bible, the Elements is the most translated, published, and studied of all the books produced in the Western world. Euclid may not have been a first-class mathematician, but he set a standard for deductive reasoning and geometric instruction that persisted, practically unchanged, for more than 2,000 years.
