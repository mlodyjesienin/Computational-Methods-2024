About this book

                    "Field Theory Concepts" is a new approach to the teaching
and understanding of field theory. Exploiting formal analo-
gies of electric, magnetic, and   conduction fields and
introducing generic concepts results in a             transparently
structured electomagnetic field theory. Highly                illustrative
terms alloweasyaccess to the concepts of curl and div          which
generally are conceptually demanding. Emphasis is placed on
the   static, quasistatic and dynamic nature of fields.
Eventually, numerical     field calculation algorithms, e.g.
Finite Element method and Monte Carlo    method, are presented
in a concise yet illustrative manner.
