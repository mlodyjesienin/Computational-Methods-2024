                    About this edition
                  





A thorough introduction to a natural, geometric and intuitively appealing branch of mathematics! Topology is an excellent subject for one wanting to develop skills in writing clear and precise proofs. Written with the mathematically mature reader in mind, Patty's introductory treatment includes easy-to-follow, thorough proofs as well as clear and direct notation. Historical comments are dispersed throughout, and there are many exercises of varying degrees of difficulty.
