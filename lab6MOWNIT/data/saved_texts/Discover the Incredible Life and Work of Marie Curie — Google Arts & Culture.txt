After she and Pierre Curie discovered two new radioactive elements (1898) she went on to become: the first woman professor at the Faculty of Sciences at the Sorbonne (1906), a member of the Physics Solvay Council (1911-1933) and tof the Academy of Medicine (1922), and a two time Nobel Prize winner (1903 and 1911)...""The story of her life and scientific work is a rediscovery of a major part of the history of the twentieth century."The Sklodowski's children, 1872 (coll.

After her excellent school examination results, she had to stop her studies as girls were not admitted to universities in Poland. She decided to give private lessons to help support her family, particularly her sister Bronislawa who was a medical student in Paris. She later joined her in Paris to pursue her higher education in 1891 at the Faculty of Sciences at the Sorbonne.Marie at Paris in 1892 (coll. ACJC), Source : Musée Curie (coll.

On April 19th 1906, Pierre Curie was killed in a road accident, near the Academy of Sciences in Paris. He was forty-six.He left Marie alone, with her two daughters, to continue to pursue their  research.Eve, Marie and Irène, 1908 (coll. ACJC), Source : Musée Curie (coll.

She traveled to the United States where she was received this with pride.In 1922, Marie Curie was elected as a member of the Academy of Medicine. She was also a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations.Marie Curie with the US President W.G. Harding, Washington D.C., May 20th1921 (coll.
