OverviewTest Series

Every polynomial equation of the nth degree has 'n' roots, which could be real or imaginary. If α is a root of the equation f (x) = 0, then the polynomial f (x) is exactly divisible by (x – α). This means that (x – α) is a factor of the polynomial f (x).



The study of algebraic equations, which are equations defined by a polynomial, in algebra is known as the

theory of equations

. A polynomial is an expression that contains one or more terms. The main challenge in the theory of equations was to determine when an algebraic equation has an algebraic solution. In this comprehensive guide, we will delve deeper into the theory of equations and explore examples of solving equations.




Here are some key concepts that fall under the theory of equations.





Linear equations




Simultaneous linear equations




Finding the integer solutions of an equation or of a system of equations




Systems of polynomial equations




Key Points to Remember




Here are some important concepts you need to know in the theory of equations:





A quadratic equation in x generally takes the form ax



2



+ bx + c  = 0




The roots of a quadratic equation are given by x = (-b±√(b



2



– 4ac))/2a




If α and β are the roots of the equation ax



2



+ bx + c  = 0, a ≠ 0, then the sum of roots, α + β = -b/a.





The product of roots is given by  αβ = c/a





If the sum and product of roots are known, then the quadratic equation can be represented as

x

2

– (sum of roots)x + product of roots = 0





For a quadratic equation, b




2




– 4ac is known as the discriminant and is represented by D.




If D = 0, the equation will have two identical real roots.




If D > 0, then the equation will have two different real roots.




If D < 0, then the equation has no real roots.




The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola. The parabola will open upwards if a >0, and open downwards if a < 0.




If a > 0, when x = -b/2a, f(x) attains its minimum value.




If a < 0, when x = -b/2a, f(x) attains its maximum value.

are the roots of the quadratic equation:




\(\begin{array}{l}a_{0} ­x^{n} + a_{1} ­x^{n-1} + a_{2} ­x^{n – 2} + a_{3} ­x^{n – 3} + a_{4} ­x^{n – 4 }+ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . + a_{n-1} x + a_{n} = 0\end{array} \)



Then, the sum of roots:




\(\begin{array}{l}\sum \alpha_{1} = \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2} + \alpha_{3} + \alpha_{4} . . . . . . \alpha_{n}=\mathbf{-\;\frac{a_{1}}{a_{o}}}\end{array} \)



The sum of the product of roots taken two at a time:




\(\begin{array}{l}\sum \alpha_{1} \alpha_{2} = \mathbf{\frac{a_{2}}{a_{o}}}\end{array} \)



The sum of the product of roots taken three at a time:




\(\begin{array}{l}\sum \alpha_{1} . \alpha_{2} .\alpha_{3}=\mathbf{-\;\frac{a_{3}}{a_{o}}}\end{array} \)

The product of roots:




\(\begin{array}{l}\alpha_{1} . \alpha_{2} . \alpha_{3} . \alpha_{4} . \alpha_{5}. . . . . . \alpha_{n} = (- 1)^{n} \times \frac{a_{n}}{a_{o}}\end{array} \)



Thus, for a cubic equation


\(\begin{array}{l}ax^{3} + bx^{2} + cx + d = 0\end{array} \)





\(\begin{array}{l}\alpha{1} + \alpha_{2} + \alpha_{3}=\mathbf{-\;\frac{a_{1}}{a_{o}}}=\mathbf{-\;\frac{b}{a}}\end{array} \)





\(\begin{array}{l}\alpha_{1}.\alpha_{2} + \alpha_{2}. \alpha_{3}+ \alpha_{3}.\alpha_{1}=\mathbf{\frac{a_{2}}{a_{o}}}=\mathbf{\frac{c}{a}}\end{array} \)





\(\begin{array}{l}\alpha_{1}.\alpha_{2} . \alpha_{3} = (- 1)^{n} \times \frac{a_{3}}{a_{o}}=-\frac{d}{a}\end{array} \)

Solving Problems in Theory of Equations




Problem 1: If one root of a cubic equation is double of another, find all the roots of the equation x

3

+ 36 = 7x

2

.




Solution:



Given, f (x) = x

3

– 7x

2

+ 0.x + 36


Let α, β, and γ be the roots of the given cubic function f (x).


We know, α + β + γ =

-b/a

= 7 . . . . . . (1)


Also, αβ + γβ + αγ =

c/a

= 0 . . . . . . . . . . (2)


And, αβγ =

-d/a

= – 36 . . . . . . . . (3)


Given that α = 2β,


3β + γ = 7 [From Equation (1)] . . . . . . . . . . . (4)


Also, 2β

2

+ 3βγ = 0 [From Equation (2)]

β (2β + 3γ) = 0


Since β ≠ 0, 2β + 3γ = 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (5)


And, 2β

2

γ = – 36 [From Equation (3)] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (6),


On solving Equation (4) and Equation (5), we get,


β = 3 and γ = – 2


Therefore, the roots of equation x

3

+ 36 = 7x

2

are 3, 6, and – 2.



Problem 2: If x, y, and z are real variables satisfying the equations x + y + z = 5 and xy + yz+ zx = 8, determine the range of x.




Solution:



Given, x + y + z = 5


Therefore, z = 5 – (y + x) . . . . . . . . . . . . (1)


Substituting the values of Equation (1) in xy + yz+ zx = 8, we get,


xy + z (y+ z) = 8,


i.e., xy + (y + z) (5 – y- x) = 8,


Or,

xy + 5y – y

2

– yx + 5x – xy – x

2

= 8



Or,

y

2

– (5 – x)y – 5x + 8 + x

2

= 0



Now,

b

2

– 4ac (D) ≥ 0

[Since, y is real]

i.e.,

(5 – x)

2

– 4 (x

2

– 5x + 8) ≥ 0

,


Or,

x

2

+ 25 – 10x – 4x

2

+ 20x – 32 ≥ 0

,


Or,

– 3x

2

+ 10x – 7 ≥ 0

,


Or,

3x

2

– 10x + 7 ≤ 0

. . . . . . . . . . . (2)


Now, the roots of the

quadratic equation


3x

2

– 10x + 7 = 0





\(\begin{array}{l}x = \mathbf{\frac{+\;10\;\pm \;\sqrt{100\;-\;84}}{6}\;=\;\frac{10\;\pm \;4}{6}\;=\;\frac{7}{3},\;1}\end{array} \)



Therefore, from Equation (2),




\(\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{\left ( x\;-\;1 \right )\;\left ( x\;-\;\frac{7}{3} \right )}\le 0\end{array} \)





\(\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{x\;\in \;\left [ 1, \;\frac{7}{3} \right ]}\end{array} \)

.



Problem 3: If α and β are the roots of the quadratic equation 2x

2

+ 6x + k = 0, find the maximum value of [(α/β) + (β/α)] if k < 0.




Solution:



From the given quadratic equation 2x

2

+ 6x + k = 0,


α + β = – 3 and αβ = k/2


Since, k < 0, D = (

b

2

– 4ac

) = 36 – 4k > 0.


Hence, the roots of the quadratic equation α and β are real.


Now,


\(\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{\left [\;\frac{\alpha }{\beta }\;+\;\frac{\beta }{\alpha }\; \right ]}=\mathbf{\left [\;\frac{\alpha^{2} \;+\;\beta ^{2}}{\alpha \;\beta }\right ]}\end{array} \)





\(\begin{array}{l}=\mathbf{\frac{\left ( \alpha \;+\; \beta \right )^{2}}{\alpha\; \beta }\;-\;2}\end{array} \)





\(\begin{array}{l}=\mathbf{\frac{18}{k}\;-\;2}\end{array} \)



Since k < 0, the maximum possible value of the above expression is -2.


Hence, the maximum value of [(α/β) + (β/α)]= – 2.



Problem 4: In a polynomial equation


\(\begin{array}{l}px^{4} + qx^{3} + rx^{3} + sx^{2} + tx + u = 0\end{array} \)

, the product of all the roots taken at a time is one-third of the sum of the product of roots taken two at a time. Find the relationship between ‘r’ and ‘u’.




Solution:



Let α, β, γ and δ be the roots of the given polynomial equation px

4

+ qx

3

+ rx

3

+ sx

2

+ tx + u = 0.


The sum of the product of roots taken two at a time is given by r/p.


The product of all the roots taken at a time is given by u/p.


According to the given condition, r/p = 3(u/p).


Therefore, r = 3u.



Problem 5: Solve the equation 3x

3

– x + 88 = 4x

2

if one of the roots of the given cubic polynomial equation is 2 – i√7.




Solution:



Let f (x) = 3x

3

– x + 88 – 4x

2



The given cubic function will have three roots, i.e., α, β and γ.


Therefore, α = x = 2 – i

√7



And, β = x = 2 + i

√7

[Since imaginary roots occur in conjugate pairs]

Therefore,


(x – 2 + i

√7)(x – 2 – i√7) = (x – 2)


2


+ 7



= x


2


– 4x + 11


= g (x)


On dividing f (x) by g (x), we will get 3x + 8 as the quotient.


Therefore, 3x + 8 = 0


Hence,

γ = -8/3



Therefore, the roots of the given equation f (x) are 2 – i

√7, 2 + i√7, γ = -8/3.
