In 1654, Newton was enrolled at The King’s School, Grantam Grammar School at age 12 located in Grantham, Lincolnshire. He lodged with a local apothecary, who helped build up his interest in chemistry and the undeveloped medicine fields. Excelling in all his courses, he also erected an interest in reading books, creating novel models, and chemistry. As a result, once he banged a peg into a wall, marked hours around it, and saw its shadow move, telling time at amazing accuracy. In addition, he generated a windmill operated by a mouse running on a treadmill. Though, Newton had a complex personality, since at school he carved his name on every bench he sat on, including some stone window ledges.

He also found out how to determine the average speed of something by using the formula distance divided by time is equal to the average speed of the object. With that he also developed a new type of math called calculus which is the understanding of ways things change.
