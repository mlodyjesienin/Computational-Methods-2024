The new edition of this handbook starts with a short introduction to functional analysis, including a review of complex analysis, before continuing a systematic discussion of different types of integral equations. After a few remarks on the historical development, the second part provides an introduction to the calculus of variations and the relationship between integral equations and applications of the calculus of variations. It further covers applications of the calculus of variations developed in the second half of the 20th century in the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. Throughout the book, the author presents a wealth of problems and examples often with a physical background. He provides outlines of the solutions for each problem, while detailed solutions are also given, supplementing the materials discussed in the main text. The problems can be solved by directly applying the method illustrated in the main text, and difficult problems are accompanied by a citation of the original references. Highly recommended as a textbook for senior undergraduates and first-year graduates in science and engineering, this is equally useful as a reference or self-study guide.About the AuthorMichio Masujima, born in 1947, studied physics and mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University. He received his PhD in mathematics from the MIT in 1983. Dr. Masujima worked for many years at the NEC Fundamental Research Laboratory in Japan, where he was in charge of computational physics, and later as a lecturer at the NEC Junior Technical College, where he was responsible for the subjects mathematics and physics.
