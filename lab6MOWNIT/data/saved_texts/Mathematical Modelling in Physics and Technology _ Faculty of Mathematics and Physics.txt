Mathematical Modelling in Physics and Technology

Coordinated by: Mathematical Institute of Charles University
Study branch coordinator: prof. RNDr. Josef Málek, CSc., DSc.

Mathematical modelling is an interdisciplinary field connecting
mathematical analysis, numerical mathematics, and physics. The
curriculum is designed to provide excellent basic knowledge in all
these disciplines and to allow a flexible widening of knowledge by
studying specialized literature when the need arises. All students
take obligatory courses in continuum mechanics, partial differential
equations, and numerical mathematics. Students will acquire the 
ability to design mathematical models of natural phenomena (especially
related to continuum mechanics and thermodynamics), analyse them, and
conduct numerical simulations. After passing the obligatory classes,
students get more closely involved with physical aspects of
mathematical modelling (model design), with mathematical analysis of
partial differential equations, or with methods for computing
mathematical models. The grasp of all levels of mathematical modelling
(model, analysis, simulations) allows the students to use modern
results from all relevant fields to address problems in physics,
technology, biology, and medicine that surpass the scope of the 
fields individually. Graduates will be able to pursue academic or commercial careers
in applied mathematics, physics and technology.
The graduate will have mastered methods and results in continuum
mechanics and thermodynamics, mathematical analysis of partial
differential equations, and numerical mathematics, and will be ready to
widen his/her knowledge by studying specialized literature. He/she will be able to 
formulate questions regarding the physical substance of natural
phenomena, especially those related to the behaviour of fluids and
solid matter in the framework of classical physics, with applications
to technology, medicine, biology, geophysics, and meteorology. He/she
will be able to choose appropriate mathematical models for such phenomena, carry out 
its mathematical analysis, and conduct numerical simulations with
suitable methods. He/she will be able to critically analyse, evaluate, and tie in
the whole modelling process. In simpler cases, he/she will be able to
assess the errors in the modelling process and predict the agreement
between numerical results and the physical process. The graduate
will be ready to work in interdisciplinary teams. He/she will be able to pose
interesting questions in a format ready for mathematical investigation
and use abstract mathematical results in order to address applied
problems.
Assumed knowledge

It is assumed that an incoming student of this branch has sufficient
knowledge of the following topics and fields:

–
Foundations of differential and integral calculus of one variable and
several variables. Volume, surface and line integral. Measure theory.
Lebesgue integral. 
–
Foundations of linear algebra (vector spaces, matrices, determinants,
Jordan canonical form, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, multilinear
algebra, quadratic forms). Numerical solution of systems of linear
algebraic equations (Schur theorem, QR decomposition, LU
decomposition, singular value decomposition, least squares problem,
partial eigenvalue problem, conjugate gradient method, GMRES, backward
error, sensitivity and numerical stability, QR algorithm). 
–
Foundations of complex analysis (Cauchy theorem, residual theorem,
conformal mappings, Laplace transform). 
–
Foundations of functional analysis and theory of metric spaces (Banach
and Hilbert spaces, operators and functionals, Hahn-Banach theorem,
dual space, bounded operators, compact operators, theory of
distributions). 
– 
Foundations of theory of ordinary differential equations (existence of
solution, maximal solution, systems of linear equations, stability)
and partial differential equations (quasilinear first order equations,
Laplace equation and heat equation – fundamental solution and maximum
principle, wave equation – fundamental solution, finite propagation
speed). 
–
Foundations of classical mechanics (Newton laws, Lagrange equations,
Hamilton equations, variational formulation, rigid body dynamics). 

Should an incoming student not meet these entry requirements, the coordinator 
of the study programme may assign a method of acquiring the
necessary knowledge and abilities, which may for example mean taking selected bachelor's
courses, taking a reading course with an instructor, or following tutored
independent study.
