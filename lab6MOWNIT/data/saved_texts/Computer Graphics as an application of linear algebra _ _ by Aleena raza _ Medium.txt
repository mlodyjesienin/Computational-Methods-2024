It involves the use of software programs and hardware devices to create, modify, and display images, videos, and animations.Computer graphics can be divided into two main categories: 2D graphics and 3D graphics. 2D graphics involve creating and manipulating images with two dimensions, such as in digital art, graphic design, and typography. 3D graphics involve creating and manipulating objects in a three-dimensional space, often used in video games, films, and virtual reality.Computer graphics also include techniques for image processing, computer vision, and visualization of data. These techniques can be used to enhance and analyze images, simulate real-world scenarios, and display data in an understandable and visually compelling way.Linear Algebra used in computer graphics:Linear algebra is used extensively in computer graphics to model and manipulate objects in a 3D space. Matrices and vectors are used to represent transformations, such as rotations, translations, and scaling.In this blog , i will also explore the ways in which linear algebra is used for computer graphics .Linear algebra plays a critical role in computer graphics. It is used to represent and manipulate geometric objects such as points, vectors, lines, planes, and shapes. Here are some specific ways in which linear algebra is used for computer graphics:Coordinate transformations: Linear algebra is used to transform objects in 3D space. This includes translating, scaling, and rotating objects. A transformation matrix is used to represent these operations, and matrix multiplication is used to apply the transformation to a geometric object.Projection: Linear algebra is used to project 3D objects onto a 2D screen. This involves converting 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates using a projection matrix.Lighting and shading: Linear algebra is used to calculate the lighting and shading of 3D objects. This involves computing the normal vectors of surfaces, which are used to determine the angle between the surface and the light source. This information is used to compute the amount of light reflected by the surface.Camera modeling: Linear algebra is used to model the camera in 3D space. This includes defining the camera position, orientation, and field of view.Curve and surface modeling: Linear algebra is used to model curves and surfaces in 3D space. This involves representing the curves and surfaces using mathematical equations, and using linear algebra to manipulate them.How computer graphics relates with linear algebra ?Computer graphics relies heavily on linear algebra because it involves creating and manipulating three-dimensional objects in a virtual space. Linear algebra provides the mathematical framework for performing these operations, such as translating, rotating, and scaling objects.In particular, linear algebra is used to represent and manipulate geometric transformations, such as rotations and translations, which are essential for creating the illusion of movement and depth in computer graphics. Matrices and vectors are used to represent these transformations, and linear algebra provides the tools for multiplying and combining these matrices and vectors to create complex transformations.Additionally, linear algebra is used in graphics programming to perform operations such as projection, shading, and lighting, which are used to create realistic 3D images. Linear algebra is also used to solve geometric problems, such as finding the intersection of a ray with a surface, which is important for creating realistic shadows and reflections.Overall, linear algebra provides the mathematical framework for representing and manipulating 3D objects in computer graphics. Without it, it would be difficult to create realistic 3D images and animations.----1FollowWritten by Aleena raza68 FollowersFollowHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams
