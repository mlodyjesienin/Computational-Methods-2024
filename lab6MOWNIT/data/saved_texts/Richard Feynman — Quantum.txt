Richard Feynman










Richard Feynman





Richard Feynman was an American theoretical physicist. His contribution to quantum mechanics and electrodynamics have been particularly remarkable. He was one of the contributors in the atomic bomb development during the World War II, in 1948 he introduced the Feynman diagram, graphic representation of different particles interactions, and in 1965 he won the Nobel prize for his contributions to developing the quantum field theory (QFT). He was nominated one of the more influential physicist of all time by the British Journal ‘Physics World’.
