Tesla (1856)




Nikola Tesla (1856)

Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Austria-Hungary and emigrated to the U.S. in 
									1884 as a physicist. He pioneered the generation, transmission, and use of alternating 
									current (AC) electricity, which can be transmitted over much greater distances 
									than direct current. 

									Tesla patented a device to induce electrical current in a piece of iron (a rotor) 
									spinning between two electrified coils of wire. This rotating magnetic field 
									device generates AC current when it is made to rotate by using some form mechanical 
									energy, like steam or hydropower. When the generated current reaches its user 
									and is fed into another rotating magnetic field device, this second device becomes 
									an AC induction motor that produces mechanical energy. Induction motors run 
									household appliances like clothes washers and dryers. Development of these devices 
									led to widespread industrial and manufacturing uses for electricity. 

									The induction motor was only part of Tesla's overall conception. In a series 
									of history-making patents, he demonstrated a polyphase alternating-current system, 
									consisting of a generator, transformers, transmission layout, and motor and 
									lights. From the power source to the power user, it provided the basic elements 
									for electrical production and utilization. Our AC power system remains essentially 
									unchanged today.

In 1888, George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company, bought 
									the patent rights to Tesla's system of dynamos, transformers and motors. Westinghouse 
									used Tesla's alternating current system to light the World's Columbian Exposition 
									of 1893 in Chicago. Then in 1896, Tesla's system was used at Niagara Falls in 
									the world's first large hydroelectric plant. The Tesla coil, invented in 1891, 
									is still used in radio and television sets, car starters, and a wide variety 
									of electronic equipment. 

									Tesla's work with radio-frequency waves laid the foundation for today's radio. 
									He experimented with wireless transmission of electrical power, and received 
									112 patents for devices ranging from speedometers to extremely efficient electrical 
									generators to a bladeless turbine still in use today. He suggested that it was 
									possible to use radio waves to detect ships (later developed as RADAR), and 
									his work with special gas-filled lamps set the stage for the creation of fluorescent 
									lighting. 

									Tesla was Thomas Edison's rival at the end of the 19th century - in fact, he 
									was more famous than Edison throughout the 1890's. His invention of polyphase 
									AC electric power earned him worldwide fame but not fortune. At his zenith his 
									circle of friends included poets and scientists, industrialists and financiers. 
									Yet Tesla died alone and almost penniless in a New York hotel room in 1943. 
									During his life, Tesla created a legacy of genuine invention that still fascinates 
									today. After his death, the world honored him by naming the unit of magnetic 
									flux density the "tesla."
