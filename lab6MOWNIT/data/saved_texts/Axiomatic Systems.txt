  arranged have a different effect.


Blaise Pascal (16231662)
      Axiomatic System (Postulate System)
            1.   Undefined terms/primitive terms
            2.   Defined terms
            3.   Axioms/postulates - accepted unproved statements
            4.   Theorems - proved statements
      An  axiomatic system consists of some undefined 
terms (primitive terms) and a list of statements, called  axioms or
 
postulates, concerning the undefined terms. One obtains a mathematical 
theory by proving new statements, called  theorems, using only the axioms 
(postulates), logic system, and previous theorems. Definitions are made in the 
process in order to be more concise. 
      Most early Greeks made a distinction between axioms 
and postulates. Evidence exists that Euclid made the distinction that an axiom 
(common notion) is an assumption common to all sciences and that a postulate is 
an assumption peculiar to the particular science being studied. Now in modern 
times no distinction is made between the two; an axiom or postulate is an 
assumed statement.
      Usually an axiomatic system does not stand alone, but 
other systems are also assumed to hold.  For example, we will assume: 
              1.   the real number system,
              2.   some set theory,
              3.   Aristotelian 
logic system, and
              4.   the English language.
We will not develop any of these but use what we need from 
them.
      One of the pitfalls of working with a deductive 
system is too great a familiarity with the subject matter of the system.  We 
need to be careful with what we are assuming to be true and with saying 
something is obvious while writing a proof. We need to take extreme care that we 
do not make an additional assumption outside the system being studied. A common 
error in the writing of proofs in geometry is to base the proof on a picture. A 
picture may be misleading, either by not covering all possibilities, or by 
reflecting our unconscious bias as to what is correct. It is crucially 
important in a proof to use only the axioms and the theorems which have been 
derived from them and not depend on any preconceived idea or picture. 
Pictures should only be used as an intuitive aid in developing the proof, but 
each step in the proof should depend only on the axioms and the theorems with no 
dependence upon any picture. Diagrams should be used as an aid, since they 
are useful in developing conceptual understanding, but care must be taken that 
the diagrams do not lead to misunderstanding. Two exercises in Chapter Two 
illustrate this point: (1) 
A false 
proof that all triangles are isosceles. (2)
A faulty proof of a valid theorem. 
      Usually not all the axioms are given at the beginning 
of the development of an axiomatic system; this allows us to prove very general 
theorems which hold for many axiomatic systems.  An example from abstract 
algebra is:  group theory 
→ ring theory
→ field theory. A second example is a 
parallel postulate is often not introduced early in studies of Euclidean geometry, so the theorems 
developed will hold for both Euclidean and hyperbolic geometry (called a neutral 
geometry).
      Certain terms are left undefined to prevent circular 
definitions, and the axioms are stated to give properties to the undefined 
terms. Undefined terms are of two types: terms that imply objects, called
elements, and terms that 
imply relationships between objects, called  relations. Examples of undefined terms (primitive terms) 
in geometry are point, line, 
plane, on, and between. For these undefined terms, on and between would indicate 
some undefined relationship between undefined objects such as point and line. An 
example would be: A point is on a line.  Early geometers tried to define these terms:
            point    Pythagoreans, a monad having 
position"
                        Plato, the beginning of a line"
                        Euclid, that which has no part"
            line      Proclus, magnitude in one 
dimension",  flux of a point"
                        Euclid, breadthless length"
Euclid made the attempt to define all of his terms. (See 
Euclid's 
Elements.) Now, 
points are considered to come before lines, but no effort is made to define them 
a priori. Instead, material things are used as illustrations/models to obtain 
the abstract idea. The famous mathematician David Hilbert (18621943) is quoted 
as saying, we may as well be talking about chairs, coffee tables and beer 
mugs."
      An axiomatic system is
 consistent if there is 
no statement such that both the statement and its negation are axioms or 
theorems of the axiomatic system. Since contradictory axioms or theorems 
are usually not desired in an axiomatic system, we will consider consistency to 
be a necessary condition for an axiomatic system. An axiomatic system that does 
not have the property of consistency has no mathematical value and is generally 
not of interest.
      A  model of an axiomatic system is obtained if 
we can assign meaning to the undefined terms of the axiomatic system which 
convert the axioms into true statements about the assigned concepts. Two types 
of models are used  concrete models and
 abstract models. A model is 
concrete if the meanings assigned to the undefined terms are objects and 
relations adapted from the real world. A model is abstract if the meanings 
assigned to the undefined terms are objects and relations adapted from another 
axiomatic development.
      Consistency is often difficult to prove. One method for showing that an axiomatic system is 
consistent is to use a model. When a concrete model has been exhibited, we say 
we have established the  absolute consistency of the axiomatic system. Basically, we believe that contradictions in the real world 
are impossible.  If we exhibit an abstract model where the axioms of the first 
system are theorems of the second system, then we say the first axiomatic system 
is  relatively consistent. Relative consistency is usually the best we can 
hope for since concrete models are often difficult or impossible to set up. 
An axiomatic system is complete if every 
statement containing the undefined and defined terms of the system can be proved 
valid or invalid. Also, 
Kurt Gödel (19061978) with his 
Incompleteness Theorem (published in 1931 
in Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik) demonstrated that even in 
elementary parts of arithmetic there exist propositions which cannot be proved 
or disproved within the system.
      In an axiomatic system, an axiom is
 independent 
if it is not a theorem that follows from the other axioms. Independence is not a 
necessary requirement for an axiomatic system; whereas, consistency is 
necessary. For example, in high school geometry courses, theorems which are long 
and difficult to prove are usually taken as axioms/postulates. Hence in most 
high school geometry courses, the axiom sets are usually not independent. In fact, in this 
course, though we will be much more rigorous than in a high school course, we 
may at times take some theorems as postulates.
      Many people throughout history have thought that 
Euclid's Fifth Postulate (parallel postulate) was not independent of the other 
axioms. Many people tried to prove this axiom but either failed or used faulty 
reasoning. This problem eventually led to the development of other geometries, 
and Euclid's Fifth Postulate was shown to be independent of the other postulates. We will not be 
assuming the parallel postulate at the beginning of our study of Euclidean 
geometry; this will allow us to develop 
many theorems which are valid in some non-Euclidean geometries.
      Models of an axiomatic system are
 isomorphic 
if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their elements that preserves 
all relations. That is, the models are abstractly the same; only the notation is 
different. An axiomatic system is  categorical if every two models of the 
system are isomorphic.
      In a geometry with two 
undefined primitive terms, the dual of an axiom or theorem is the 
statement with the two terms interchanged. For example, the dual of "A line 
contains at least two points," is "A point contains at least two lines." 
An 
axiom system in which the dual of any axiom or theorem is also an axiom or 
theorem is said to satisfy the principle of duality. 
Plane projective 
geometry, which we will study later in the course, is an example of a geometry 
that satisfies the principal of duality.
God exists since 
mathematics is consistent, and the devil exists since we cannot prove the 
consistency.
