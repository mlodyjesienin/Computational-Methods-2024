Topology is the branch of Mathematics which focuses on properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching, crumpling, and bending, but not tearing or gluing.
Topology is like looking at shapes and spaces but in a flexible and stretchy way. Instead of worrying about measurements like distance or angles, we’re more interested in how things fit together and what we can say about them without changing their basic shape.
Let’s know more about Topology, and uses & applications of topology in real life.

What is Topology?
Topology is the branch of mathematics that deals with properties that remain invariant through deformations, twisting, and stretching of objects. It has numerous real-life applications across various fields.
Imagine you have a rubber band and a clay ball. If you can stretch and squish the rubber band and the clay ball in any way you want without tearing or cutting them, they’re considered the same in topology. It’s kind of like saying a doughnut and a coffee cup are the same shape because you can bend and mold one into the other without breaking or gluing anything.
Topology helps us understand how things are connected and how they can be transformed without changing their essential features. It’s a bit like playing with putty or modeling clay but with more complicated shapes and ideas. We use it in lots of different fields like math, and science, and even in understanding networks and shapes in the real world.
Topology Meaning
Topology refers to the branch of mathematics that studies the properties of space that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching, bending, and deforming, but not tearing or gluing. The focus is on understanding the qualitative, rather than quantitative, aspects of space.
Applications of Topology
Topology might seem complex, but let’s discuss the example of topology in our daily life with few examples.
Clothing and Folding
We change their shape when we fold clothes or blankets without altering their fundamental properties. In topology, this idea relates to “equivalence classes” where objects are considered the same if they can be transformed into each other without tearing or gluing. So, whether we fold a T-shirt neatly or scrunch it up, from a topological perspective, it’s still the same T-shirt.
Knots and Tangles
Topology helps us understand knots and tangles. Just like untangling a necklace or a bunch of wires, topologists study how knots can be untangled or transformed without cutting or retying. This has practical applications in fields like sailing (tying knots), surgery (untangling blood vessels), and even computer graphics (untangling virtual wires).
Navigation and Maps
When we navigate through a city using a map, we’re essentially dealing with topology. Maps don’t always preserve distances or angles accurately, but they do capture the essential connectivity between roads, streets, and landmarks. Topology helps us understand how different routes are related and how we can move from one place to another without getting lost.
Phone Networks 
Think about how your phone connects to the internet or how calls are routed through a network of towers and cables. Topology helps engineers design efficient networks by understanding how devices are connected and how data flows between them. Ensuring there are no dead ends or bottlenecks in the network is a topological consideration.
Food Preparation
In cooking, the way ingredients are mixed or layered can be seen through a topological lens. Whether you’re folding dough for a pastry, layering lasagna sheets, or braiding bread, you’re manipulating shapes and connections in a way that preserves their essential properties.
These examples illustrate how topology, although often associated with abstract mathematical concepts, has practical applications in various aspects of our daily lives, from folding laundry to navigating cities.
Digital Image Processing
Topology is used in image processing as:

Image Segmentation: Topological methods are used to divide an image into meaningful regions or segments based on their connectivity and topological properties. This segmentation is essential for tasks such as object recognition, image compression, and medical image analysis.


Feature Extraction: Topological features such as loops, holes, and connected components are extracted from images to represent their structural information. These features help in characterizing shapes, textures, and patterns in images, facilitating tasks like image matching, classification, and retrieval.


Shape Analysis: Topology aids in analyzing and comparing the shapes of objects in images. Techniques such as persistent homology are used to quantify topological features and derive shape descriptors, allowing for robust shape recognition and shape-based image retrieval.


Topological-Based Filters: Topological filters, such as homotropy-based filters and shape-preserving filters, are employed to enhance and denoise images while preserving important topological features. These filters improve image quality and assist in feature extraction and object detection.


Pattern Recognition: Topological invariants, such as Euler characteristics and Betti numbers, are utilized in pattern recognition algorithms to discriminate between different shapes and structures in images. These invariants provide robustness against noise, occlusions, and deformations in the images. 

Civil Engineering
Topology is used in civil engineering as:

Structural Analysis: Topological concepts are used to analyze the connectivity, stability, and load-bearing capacity of structural elements such as beams, columns, and trusses. This analysis ensures the safety and efficiency of engineered structures, leading to improved structural designs.


Geographical Analysis: Topology is applied in geographic information systems (GIS) to model spatial relationships between geographical features such as roads, rivers, buildings, and land parcels. This spatial analysis aids in urban planning, environmental assessment, land use management, and infrastructure development.


Optimization of Networks: Topology-based optimization techniques are used to design and optimize transportation networks, water distribution systems, electrical grids, and communication networks. These optimizations aim to minimize costs, reduce energy consumption, improve network resilience, and enhance overall performance.


Topology-Based Design: Topological optimization methods are employed in structural and mechanical design to generate efficient and lightweight structures while maintaining structural integrity. These methods help engineers explore innovative design possibilities and achieve optimal solutions for complex engineering problems.

Molecular Biology and Protein Folding
In molecular biology, understanding the three-dimensional structure of biomolecules is paramount to deciphering their functions and mechanisms. Topological methods offer insights into how biomolecules such as DNA and proteins fold and interact, influencing their stability, activity, and regulatory processes. By applying topological principles to analyze molecular structures, researchers can unravel the intricate dance of atoms and bonds that underlie biological phenomena.  
Topology is used to study various biological systems including molecules and nanostructure. Circuit topology and knot theory have been applied to classify and compare the topology of folded proteins and nucleic acids.
Geographical Analysis And Spatial Data 
Topology plays a crucial role in geographical analysis and spatial data processing, particularly in areas such as urban planning, environmental modeling, and geographical information systems (GID). Topological relationships between geographical features, such as connectivity, proximity, and containment, are fundamental to decision-making processes in land use, transportation networks, disaster management, and resource allocation.
By employing topological algorithms and techniques, geographers and planners can create spatial models that accurately represent real-world phenomena and facilitate informed decision-making.   
Material Science and Soft Matter Physics
Study of materials and their properties is integral to advancements in material science and soft matter physics. Topology contributes to this field by examining the structural configurations and phase transitions of materials, including polymers, colloids, and complex fluids. By characterizing the topological properties of materials, scientists can design novel materials with tailored functionalities, such as shape memory alloys, self-healing polymers, and responsive nanomaterials.
Robotics and Motion Planning
In robotics, topology plays an important role in motion planning algorithms that govern the movement and interaction of robotic systems. By modeling the environment and robot configuration spaces using topological methods, engineers can devise efficient paths for robots to navigate complex terrains, avoid obstacles, and perform manipulation tasks. Topological maps and graphs represent the connectivity and accessibility of spaces, enabling robots to make informed decisions and execute tasks with precision and adaptability.
This integration of topology into robotics enhances autonomy, safety, and versatility in robotic applications across domains such as manufacturing, healthcare, exploration, and service industries.  
Network Analysis and Communication Systems
Analysis of complex networks, such as social networks, neural networks, and communication systems, relies on topological principles to uncover hidden structures and dynamics. Topological metrics, such as centrality, clustering coefficient, and network motifs, provide insights into network resilience, information flow, and emergent behaviors. 
By applying topological methods to network analysis, researchers can identify critical nodes, detect patterns of connectivity, and optimize network performance in areas such as information dissemination, disease spread modeling, traffic management, and cybersecurity.

Summary
Topology is often referred as “rubber-sheet geometry,”. It is a fascinating area of mathematics that looks at how shapes and spaces can stretch or bend without changing their fundamental properties. Imagine turning a clay ball into a flat pancake or twisting a rubber band; if you can do it without cutting or gluing, topology sees them as the same. This unique perspective helps us understand not just mathematical spaces, but also real-world applications in various fields.
For example, topology explains why a scrunched-up T-shirt and a neatly folded one are essentially the same, helps sailors and surgeons with knots and tangles, and makes our maps and GPS navigation possible. It’s behind the scenes in our phone networks, making sure calls and data flow smoothly, and it even comes into play in the kitchen, where the structure of pastries and layered dishes is all about maintaining certain properties no matter how they’re manipulated. 
Beyond these everyday examples, topology dives into complex areas like digital image processing, civil engineering, molecular biology, and robotics, offering insights and solutions to problems ranging from structural design and protein folding to robot motion planning and network analysis.
