				Top Questions
			What is algebra?Algebra is the branch of mathematics in which abstract symbols, rather than numbers, are manipulated or operated with arithmetic. For example, x + y = z or b - 2 = 5 are algebraic equations, but 2 + 3 = 5 and 73 * 46 = 3,358 are not. By using abstract symbols, mathematicians can work in general terms that are much more broadly applicable than specific situations involving numbers.How are algebra and geometry different?Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which arithmetic operations and other formal manipulations are applied to abstract symbols rather than specific numbers. Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the shape of objects, their spatial relations, and the properties of the space the objects are in.

The Algebra Problem: How Middle School Math Became a National Flashpoint


algebra,  branch of mathematics in which arithmetical operations and formal manipulations are applied to abstract symbols rather than specific numbers. The notion that there exists such a distinct subdiscipline of mathematics, as well as the term algebra to denote it, resulted from a slow historical development. This article presents that history, tracing the evolution over time of the concept of the equation, number systems, symbols for conveying and manipulating mathematical statements, and the modern abstract structural view of algebra. For information on specific branches of algebra, see elementary algebra, linear algebra, and modern algebra.  Emergence of formal equations Perhaps the most basic notion in mathematics is the equation, a formal statement that two sides of a mathematical expression are equal—as in the simple equation x + 3 = 5—and that both sides of the equation can be simultaneously manipulated (by adding, dividing, taking roots, and so on to both sides) in order to “solve” the equation. Yet, as simple and natural as such a notion may appear today, its acceptance first required the development of numerous mathematical ideas, each of which took time to mature. In fact, it took until the late 16th century to consolidate the modern concept of an equation as a single mathematical entity. Three main threads in the process leading to this consolidation deserve special attention: Attempts to solve equations involving one or more unknown quantities. In describing the early history of algebra, the word equation is frequently used out of convenience to describe these operations, although early mathematicians would not have been aware of such a concept.The evolution of the notion of exactly what qualifies as a legitimate number. Over time this notion expanded to include broader domains (rational numbers, irrational numbers, negative numbers, and complex numbers) that were flexible enough to support the abstract structure of symbolic algebra.The gradual refinement of a symbolic language suitable for devising and conveying generalized algorithms, or step-by-step procedures for solving entire categories of mathematical problems. These three threads are traced in this section, particularly as they developed in the ancient Middle East and Greece, the Islamic era, and the European Renaissance.

Numbers and Mathematics

  Problem solving in Egypt and Babylon The earliest extant mathematical text from Egypt is the Rhind papyrus (c. 1650 bc). It and other texts attest to the ability of the ancient Egyptians to solve linear equations in one unknown. A linear equation is a first-degree equation, or one in which all the variables are only to the first power. (In today’s notation, such an equation in one unknown would be 7x + 3x = 10.) Evidence from about 300 bc indicates that the Egyptians also knew how to solve problems involving a system of two equations in two unknown quantities, including quadratic (second-degree, or squared unknowns) equations. For example, given that the perimeter of a rectangular plot of land is 100 units and its area is 600 square units, the ancient Egyptians could solve for the field’s length l and width w. (In modern notation, they could solve the pair of simultaneous equations 2w + 2l =100 and wl = 600.) However, throughout this period there was no use of symbols—problems were stated and solved verbally. The following problem is typical:  Method of calculating a quantity,multiplied by 1 1/2 added 4 it has come to 10.What is the quantity that says it?First you calculate the difference of this 10 to this 4. Then 6 results.Then you divide 1 by 1 1/2. Then 2/3 results.Then you calculate 2/3 of this 6. Then 4 results.Behold, it is 4, the quantity that said it.What has been found by you is correct.  Note that except for 2/3, for which a special symbol existed, the Egyptians expressed all fractional quantities using only unit fractions, that is, fractions bearing the numerator 1. For example, 3/4 would be written as 1/2 + 1/4.

 Babylonian mathematics dates from as early as 1800 bc, as indicated by cuneiform texts preserved in clay tablets. Babylonian arithmetic was based on a well-elaborated, positional sexagesimal system—that is, a system of base 60, as opposed to the modern decimal system, which is based on units of 10. The Babylonians, however, made no consistent use of zero. A great deal of their mathematics consisted of tables, such as for multiplication, reciprocals, squares (but not cubes), and square and cube roots.
 In addition to tables, many Babylonian tablets contained problems that asked for the solution of some unknown number. Such problems explained a procedure to be followed for solving a specific problem, rather than proposing a general algorithm for solving similar problems. The starting point for a problem could be relations involving specific numbers and the unknown, or its square, or systems of such relations. The number sought could be the square root of a given number, the weight of a stone, or the length of the side of a triangle. Many of the questions were phrased in terms of concrete situations—such as partitioning a field among three pairs of brothers under certain constraints. Still, their artificial character made it clear that they were constructed for didactical purposes.
