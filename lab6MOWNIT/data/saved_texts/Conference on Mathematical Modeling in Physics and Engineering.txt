Hetman Hotel is located on the Krakow-Czestochowa Upland (popularly
known as the Jura). It is a perfect place to relax away from the hustle and
bustle of big cities. The Hotel is located 6 km from Zborow Mountain Reserve
where the Gleboka Grotto is  the first cave in the Jura that has been opened
to tourists. The Hetman is an excellent starting point base to the most
beautiful parts of the Jura (the Eagles’ Nests – Ogrodzieniec, Morsko,
Bobolice and Mirow).
