K.B.FollowKurt Lewin proposed field theory, which views behavior as a function of the person and their psychological environment (B=f(P,E)). A person's "life space" includes all factors influencing their behavior, whether consciously or not. Forces like needs, drives, beliefs and the physical environment create "vectors" that attract or repel the person. When multiple vectors conflict, it creates tensions that motivate learning as the person navigates their life space. Effective teaching aims to understand students' life spaces and use strategies like exploration to support reorganization and insight to facilitate learning.Read lessRead moreReportShareReportShare1 of 20Download nowRecommendedTolman theoryTolman theoryBaburam Bhandari Theme collection about Tolman's Purposive BehaviorismField theory of Kurt lewin pptField theory of Kurt lewin pptSafna KV Psychology field theory by Kurt lewinHull's Theory of LearningHull's Theory of LearningRathi K.

The feeling that one’s life has purpose and direction.
The perception that a person’s life matters and their  experiences make sense.
A meaningful life is  predicted by the following: 
Positive self-views (e.g., high self-esteem and self-confidence).
Seeing oneself as distinct (i.e., different from others in a positive way).
Sense of self-continuity, meaning a connection between the past and present.
Satisfaction of basic psychological needs—The need for
Autonomy, 
Relatedness, and 
Competence.
A sense of meaning in life is based on:
Perceptions of life as making sense
Feeling that one’s life matters and is worthy
Having a purpose and moving toward valued goals

Summary of Topic 6
If psychology wants to be scientific, it must study entities that are observable
Concepts like ‘psyche’, ‘personality’, ‘mind’ or ‘self’ are ruled out from the onset
Two alternatives present themselves
Studying society instead of personality: psychologists have to become sociologists
Studying behaviour, without references to internal and unobservable causes, structures, states or events: psychologists have to become behaviourists
Anyone committed to personal responsibility will find either option unattractive, for both lead to considering human beings as products of their past and present environment, automatas unable to make choices
2


Social psychology
Another option must be sought after: rather than trying to study personality or society separately, one can study the relationship between the two
Many of the words used to make sense of human existence are relational words: power, authority, obedience, conformity, parent, husband, wife, teacher, student
This is the option favoured by those authors known as social psychologists

The Hawthorne Studies
In 1924, members of the US National Academy of Science started a series of experiments at the Hawthorne plant of Western Electric
In the spirit of Taylor, their intention was to study the effect of working conditions (notably lighting, working hours, rests and pay) on productivity
The experimental findings were unexpected and seemingly incomprehensible
Productivity increased whatever experimenters did, even under adverse working conditions
Monetary incentives had seemingly very little effect
The studies were abandoned, then resumed and continued until 1932 under the supervision of Elton Mayo of Harvard Business School

Interpreting the Hawthorne Studies
If managers welcomed the findings for obvious reasons (higher wages do not lead to higher productivity), psychologists were left puzzled
Mayo’s proposed answer (widely accepted to this day) was one made on social psychological lines

Plato believed that learning is based on the mind’s innate capacity to receive information and judge its intellectual and moral value.

Plato’s foremost pupil, Aristotle, emphasized how learning involves building associations such as succession in time, contiguity in space, and similarities and/or contrasts.Psychology for nursing /nursing psychology.pptPsychology for nursing /nursing psychology.pptelizakoirala3 psychology nursingPsymbaPsymbaJ RAJESH rgfdgfdgfSimilar to Kurt Lewin's Field theory of learning (20) Kurt Lewin's Field Theory  Kurt Lewin's Field Theory   introduction to educational psychology introduction to educational psychology Introduction to educational psychology & hgdIntroduction to educational psychology & hgd the nature of social manthe nature of social man Nature, Scope & Importance of Philosophy of EducationNature, Scope & Importance of Philosophy of Education Psychological, Sociological, Economical foundations of education, and educati...Psychological, Sociological, Economical foundations of education, and educati...  ppt on educational psychology  ppt on educational psychology  Kurt lewinKurt lewin Health Health  Kurt lewinKurt lewin Need for psychological knowledge &amp; classroom interaction techniquesNeed for psychological knowledge &amp; classroom interaction techniques ReportReport Assessment in the Affective DomainAssessment in the Affective Domain Meaning In Life –Psychology of.pptxMeaning In Life –Psychology of.pptx A STUDY ON EMPLOYEE ATTITUDE A STUDY ON EMPLOYEE ATTITUDE  MGMT341 Organizational and Industrial PsychologyGroup A – at l.docxMGMT341 Organizational and Industrial PsychologyGroup A – at l.docx Formation of Attitude, How it is Changed and Rule of PrejudiceFormation of Attitude, How it is Changed and Rule of Prejudice ducational Psychology provides an internducational Psychology provides an intern Psychology for nursing /nursing psychology.pptPsychology for nursing /nursing psychology.ppt PsymbaPsymba Recently uploadedJune 3, 2024 Anti-Semitism Letter Sent to MIT President Kornbluth and MIT Cor...June 3, 2024 Anti-Semitism Letter Sent to MIT President Kornbluth and MIT Cor...Levi Shapiro Letter from the Congress of the United States regarding Anti-Semitism sent June 3rd to MIT President Sally Kornbluth, MIT Corp Chair, Mark Gorenberg

Dear Dr. Kornbluth and Mr. Gorenberg,
The US House of Representatives is deeply concerned by ongoing and pervasive acts of antisemitic 
harassment and intimidation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Failing to act decisively to ensure a safe learning environment for all students would be a grave dereliction of your responsibilities as President of MIT and Chair of the MIT Corporation. 
This Congress will not stand idly by and allow an environment hostile to Jewish students to persist. The House believes that your institution is in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the inability or 
unwillingness to rectify this violation through action requires accountability.
Postsecondary education is a unique opportunity for students to learn and have their ideas and beliefs challenged. However, universities receiving hundreds of millions of federal funds annually have denied 
students that opportunity and have been hijacked to become venues for the promotion of terrorism, antisemitic harassment and intimidation, unlawful encampments, and in some cases, assaults and riots. 
The House of Representatives will not countenance the use of federal funds to indoctrinate students into hateful, antisemitic, anti-American supporters of terrorism. Investigations into campus antisemitism by the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on Ways and Means have been expanded into a Congress-wide probe across all relevant jurisdictions to address this national crisis. The undersigned Committees will conduct oversight into the use of federal funds at MIT and its learning environment under authorities granted to each Committee.
• The Committee on Education and the Workforce has been investigating your institution since December 7, 2023. The Committee has broad jurisdiction over postsecondary education, including its compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, campus safety concerns over disruptions to the learning environment, and the awarding of federal student aid under the Higher Education Act.
• The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is investigating the sources of funding and other support flowing to groups espousing pro-Hamas propaganda and engaged in antisemitic harassment and intimidation of students. The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is the principal oversight committee of the US House of Representatives and has broad authority to investigate “any matter” at “any time” under House Rule X.
• The Committee on Ways and Means has been investigating several universities since November 15, 2023, when the Committee held a hearing entitled From Ivory Towers to Dark Corners: Investigating the Nexus Between Antisemitism, Tax-Exempt Universities, and Terror Financing. The Committee followed the hearing with letters to those institutions on January 10, 202MASS MEDIA STUDIES-835-CLASS XI Resource Material.pdfMASS MEDIA STUDIES-835-CLASS XI Resource Material.pdfgoswamiyash170123 mass media studies

KURT LEWIN
(German psychologist)
  3. FIELD
 A Field  is a psychological concept.
 Every individual has his own field of
perception and field forces.
 Field consist of a person and his psychological
environment.
Psychological environment implies the
mental world in which a person lives at a defined
moment of his life.
 4. IMPORTANT CONCEPTS IN  FIELD THEORY
 Life space
 Foreign Hull
 Topology
 Vector
 Valence
 Conflict
 Locomotion
 Barriers
 5. LIFE SPACE
 Life  space is a psychological representation of individual's
environment.
 The life space includes the person himself and everything in
his environment that influence his behavior.
 It includes both the things of which he is consciously aware
and the factors which influence him even though he is
unconscious of them .
 An object which exists, but of which the person is not aware
and which does not influence him would not be a factor of his
life space.
 6.  Similarly if  an object does not exist but of which the person
thinks to be there and reacts to it becomes a part of his life
space .
Eg: If a child thinks that there is a snake on the floor even if
it is imaginary, it is the part of his life space.
 It includes the persons , his drives, motives, believes, tensions,
thoughts, feelings and his physical environment which consist
of perceived objects and events.
 The life spaces of two persons in an identical situation may
be entirely different .
 7. A PERSON IN  LIFE SPACE.
The person is often represented as a points moving about in his life.
Psychologically a person is composed of two components
 motor perceptual stratum(abilities)
 Inner personal stratum(needs)
 8. TOPOLOGY
Topology is non-metrical  geometry which includes concepts such as
inside, outside and boundary.
FOREIGN HULL
The life space is surrounded by a non psychological boundary
called foreign hull.
 9. VECTORS
 Vectors are  borrowed from mathematical system used in
mechanics to describe the resolution of forces.
 A vector is usually represented by an arrow, it has
 Magnitude
 Direction
 Point of application
 In field psychology, a vector means a force that is influencing
psychological movement towards or away from a goal.
 10. VALENCES
 Valences are  the attracting or repelling powers of regions.
 Objects may have either positive or negative valence. The
movement of person is decided by the valence of the goal.
POSITIVE VALENCE: The object or goal which satisfy
needs or are attractive to the person.
NEGATIVE VALENCE: The object or goal which
threatens the individual or are repulsive to the person.
 A person tends to move toward a region in life space that has
positive valence and he tends to move away from a region in
life space that has negative valence.
 11. CONFLICTS
 It is  the state of tensions brought in by the presence of two
opposing desires in the individual .
 If only one vector impelling upon the individual, he will move in
the direction indicated by the vector .
 If two equally balanced vectors are operating , the result is a
conflict.
 As the person is influenced by several valences at a time, these give
rise to conflicts.
There are three types of conflicts
Approach- approach conflict
Approach – avoidance conflict
Avoidance- avoidance conflict
 12. (i) Approach- Approach  conflict
It arises when the person is caught in between two goals both having
positive valences.
It is a conflict between two positive goals which are equally attractive.
Eg: 1. A Person who wants to go two marriages scheduled at
the same time.
2. A person who wants to choose a course after completing
degree.
 13. (ii) Approach-Avoidance conflict
It  arises when the person is caught in between a positive and a negative
goal.
The same object has strong positive valence as well as negative valence.
Eg: Smoking, alcohol consumption etc is enjoyable, but they are
threat to health.
 14. (iii) Avoidance-Avoidance conflict
It  arises when a person is caught in between two goals both
having negative valences. The person is like “caught in
between devil and sea”.
Eg: A student who desires to avoid doing homework as well as
the punishment from the teacher.
 15. BARRIERS
 A barrier  is a psychological obstruction.
 They restrict the person’s movement towards the goal, and the
path he must follow to reach his goal.
 It may be objects, people, social codes anything which threatens
the motivated individual as he is moving towards a goal.
 16. LOCOMOTION
 Locomotion in  life space is delineated by a geometrical
representation of the selection of alternative, the examining of
possibilities , the setting out towards the goal.
“Learning takes place as a result of locomotion from one region
of life space to another. When a person moves from one region to
another, the structure of life space undergoes change”.
 17. According to the  field theory proposed by Kurt Lewin,
“Learning is a process of perceptual organization or
reorganization of one’s life space involving insight and
emphasizes on behavior and motivation in learning”.
According to this theory, the behavior(B) of an individual
is a function of interacting person(P) in the total
psychological environmental situation(E)
i.e. B = f(P,E)
 18. EDUCATIONAL IMPLICATION
 The  teacher should present the whole problem and evoke the
cognitive and emotional readiness in the learners for optimum
learning.
 In order to achieve optimum communication and meaningful give
and take, a teacher should try to workout the life space of each
student in his class.
 Motivation is an important factor in bringing changes in the
cognitive structure of a student In order to motivate the students,
the teacher has to identify both the driving as well as the
restraining forces present in the life space of each student.
 19.  Teacher should  organize his instructional strategies in a manner
which will be at the level of ‘exploratory’ rather than
‘explanatory understanding.’
 A change in structure of knowledge may occur with repetition.
Too much repetition does not aid learning so teacher should take
steps to avoid repetition.
 Teacher should use reward and punishment according to the
needs of the situation as Lewin accepted the value of reward and
punishment in learning.
