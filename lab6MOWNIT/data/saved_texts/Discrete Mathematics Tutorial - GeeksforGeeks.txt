Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics that is concerned with “discrete” mathematical structures instead of “continuous”. Discrete mathematical structures include objects with distinct values like graphs, integers, logic-based statements, etc. In this tutorial, we have covered all the topics of Discrete Mathematics for computer science like set theory, recurrence relation, group theory, and graph theory.

Discrete Mathematics | Hasse Diagrams
A Hasse diagram is a graphical representation of the relation of elements of a partially ordered set (poset) with an implied upward orientation. A point is drawn for each element of the partially ordered set (poset) and joined with the line segment according to the following rules: If p&lt;q in the poset, then the point corresponding to p appears l

PDNF and PCNF in Discrete Mathematics
PDNF: It stands for Principal Disjunctive Normal Form. It refers to the Sum of Products, i.e., SOP. For eg. : If P, Q, R are the variables then (P . Q' . R) + (P' . Q . R) + (P . Q . R') is an example of an expression in PDNF. Here '+' i.e. sum is the main operator. You might be confused if there exists any difference between DNF (Disjunctive Norma

Arguments in Discrete Mathematics
Arguments are an important part of logical reasoning and philosophy. It also plays a vital role in mathematical proofs. In this article, we will throw some light on arguments in logical reasoning. Logical proofs can be proven by mathematical logic. The proof is a valid argument that determines the truth values of mathematical statements. The argume

Types of Proofs - Predicate Logic | Discrete Mathematics
Introduction :The most basic form of logic is propositional logic. Propositions, which have no variables, are the only assertions that are considered. Because there are no variables in propositions, they are either always true or always false .Example - P : 2 + 4 = 5. (Always False) is a proposition.Q : y * 0 = 0. (Always true) is a proposition.

Hypergraph &amp; its representation | Discrete Mathematics
Introduction :A hypergraph is a graph in which hyperedges (generalized edges) can connect to a subset of vertices/nodes rather than two vertices/nodes.The edges (also known as hyperedges) of a hypergraph are arbitrary nonempty sets of vertices. A k-hypergraph has all such hyperedges connecting exactly k vertices; a normal graph is thus a 2-hypergra
