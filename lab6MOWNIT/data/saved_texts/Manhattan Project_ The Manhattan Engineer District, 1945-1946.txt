                      With the end of the Second World War, American
                      policymakers anticipated that the Manhattan
                      Project's infrastructure would be turned over to and
                      managed by a largely civilian commission. 
                      General Leslie Groves initially thought
                      this would happen soon after the ending of
                      hostilities.  His strategy for interim management of
                      the complex was thus one of "hold the line," where he
                      sought to maintain the essential soundness of the physical
                      plant and the personnel that ran it, complete ongoing
                      construction, and promote efficiency and economy. 
                      One of his first decisions was to close down marginal
                      operations such as the
                      S-50 Thermal Diffusion Plant in the K-25
                      area and the Alpha racetracks of the
                      Y-12 electromagnetic separations plant at
                      Oak Ridge.  His most serious short-term problem was
                      in retaining personnel, particularly at
                      Los Alamos where many scientists and
                      technicians were eager to return to civilian pursuits.
                    

                      By early 1946, Groves realized that the Manhattan Engineer
                      District's trusteeship of the complex might last for
                      an extended period of time.  He decided to abandon
                      the hold-the-line policy and begin making longer range
                      plans for the complex, even though this might restrict the
                      freedom of action for any future commission. 
                      Expiring operating contracts at major sites demanded his
                      immediate attention.  He negotiated extensions
                      through mid-1947 for all of the contracts except for at
                      Hanford, where the DuPont Corporation was
                      determined to withdraw.  Groves turned to the General
                      Electric Company, which agreed to replace DuPont.  As
                      part of the new contract to operate Hanford, General
                      Electric would also construct and operate a
                      government-owned laboratory at Knolls, a site five miles
                      from the company's home plant at Schenectady, New
                      York.  The laboratory would allow General Electric to
                      pursue the development of atomic power.
                    

With morale and personnel loss continuing to be problems
                      at Los Alamos, Groves upgraded living conditions at the
                      site with major improvements in utilities, housing, and
                      community facilities.  He also sought to focus the
                      laboratory more on weapons development by relocating
                      various weapons production and assembly activities away
                      from Los Alamos.  Already at the close of the war,
                      the engineering group of the laboratory's ordnance
                      division began consolidating weapons assembly functions at
                      Sandia Base on the old Albuquerque, New Mexico,
                      airport.  Groves now added a special Army battalion
                      at Sandia to take charge of surveillance, field tests, and
                      weapons assembly.  In addition, he negotiated an
                      agreement with Monsanto for the development and
                      manufacture at its plant in Dayton, Ohio, of weapons
                      components previously fabricated at Los Alamos.
                    

                      Groves also attempted to prevent the disintegration of the
                      nationwide nuclear research organization that had been
                      built up during the war.  Upon the advice of the
                      Advisory Committee on Research and Development that he set
                      up, Groves initiated the national laboratories system that
                      would conduct unclassified fundamental research requiring
                      equipment too expensive for the academic or private sector
                      laboratories to afford.  In April 1946, the
                      University of Chicago agreed to operate the new Argonne
                      National Laboratory formed from the existing Metallurgical
                      and Argonne laboratories.  In July, nine northeastern
                      universities banded together to operate the Brookhaven
                      National Laboratory located at an old Army camp on Long
                      Island, New York.
                    

Problems in the weapons complex nonetheless continued to
                      mount.  At Hanford, the
                      three production reactors began to show
                      signs of wear.  Sustained operation had caused
                      expansion of the graphite core of each reactor, resulting
                      in distortion of the aluminum tubes containing the uranium
                      slugs and through which the cooling water flowed. 
                      With limited operating experience, scientists and
                      engineers feared the graphite expansion would continue and
                      render all three reactors inoperable.  Potential loss
                      of polonium production was the most immediate
                      concern.  Polonium was used as a neutron source for
                      initiating the chain reaction in the plutonium device,
                      and, given polonium's half-life of only 138 days,
                      production stoppage could make existing weapons useless in
                      a matter of months.  As a result, the Army in March
                      1946 placed B reactor in standby and significantly
                      curtailed power levels on D and F reactors in an effort to
                      conserve their useful lives.
                    

Loss of plutonium production was perhaps less critical
                      due to ongoing problems at the Los Alamos
                      laboratory.  With low morale and lack of direction
                      causing many scientists experienced in weapons fabrication
                      to leave the laboratory, the Army concluded that Los
                      Alamos had lost, at least temporarily, the capability to
                      keep the more complex implosion weapon, which used
                      plutonium, in a ready state for use in the event of
                      war.  As an interim measure, the Army authorized
                      concentrated production on the gun-type weapon used at
                      Hiroshima.  The gun method was highly wasteful of
                      uranium-235, but this drawback was somewhat offset by
                      advances in the gaseous diffusion isotope separations
                      process.  The Oak Ridge
                      gaseous diffusion plants, with the new
                      K-27 plant being tied into K-25 in February 1946 to form
                      one continuous operation, over time had achieved stable
                      production rates at very high efficiencies.
                    

                      Despite Groves's best efforts, the Manhattan Project
                      complex suffered in the aftermath of the war. By early
                      1947, the nation's atomic energy establishment
                      amounted to little more than the remnants of the military
                      organization and facilities that had produced the
                      world's first atomic weapons.
