 AbstractThe differential equations of fluid flow are based on the principles of conservation of mass, momentum and energy and are known as the Navier-Stokes equations. For incompressible flows and for flows in which the temperature differences between the surface and freestream are small, the fluid properties such as density ϱ and dynamic viscosity μ in the conservation equations are not affected by temperature. This assumption allows us to ignore the conservation equation for energy and concentrate only on the conservation equations for mass and momentum.
