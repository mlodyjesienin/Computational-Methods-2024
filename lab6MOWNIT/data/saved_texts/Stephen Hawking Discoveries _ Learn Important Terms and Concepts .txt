Stephen William Hawking was an English theoretical physicist. The job role of a physicist is not very easy. Physicists are a type of scientist who specialises in the field of physics. These scientists are quite interesting as they explore the fundamental properties and everything related to it that govern space, time, energy, and matter.Studying in these areas Stephen Hawking made a long Stephen Hawking discoveries list. This physicist over his lifetime wrote various theoretical books and made big assumptions related to the world. We are sure now this is getting quite interesting for the kids doesn’t it? Now, further, in this article, we will talk about Stephen Hawking's discoveries list and much more.Who is Stephen Hawking? Stephen Hawking was a well-known English cosmologist, mathematician, and physicist. Stephen Hawking, whose real name was Stephen William Hawking, is regarded as one of the key modern-day scientists who explained the concept of black holes and Big bang theory. On January 8, 1942, Stephen Hawking was born, and Oxford is well-known as his birthplace. Stephen Hawking was so sharp that at the age of 17, he already started his university education. Hawking’s scientific works are what he is best known for. In fact, one of his works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theory. It is where both studied general relativity, black holes, and emit radiations. Interestingly, Hawking called the whole procedure “Hawking Radiation”.Throughout his lifetime, he achieved huge success with several research works. In most of his works, he discussed his theories on various physics knowledge. In fact, he was a big supporter of the world's interpretation of quantum physics. 




Stephen Hawking What are the Discoveries of Stephen Hawking? Stephen Hawking has made a long list of famous and well-known discoveries. Some famous discoveries or theories given by Stephen Hawking are the following:-A Universe That Has No Space-Time Boundaries Stephen Hawking researched quite a lot when it came to space and time. In some way or the other, this physicist proved that the universe has no space-time boundaries. He tried proving this theory using various mathematical calculations and physics experiments. In this discovery, he believed that you can’t have time or space before the Big Bang. As a result, this proved that the universe has no space-time boundaries. 




A Universe that has no Space-Time Boundaries Black Hole Radiation Hawking was quite known for his various black hole assumptions and theories. According to Hawking, a black hole is a collapsed star that has zero volume and infinite mass. They are believed to be very dense and nothing could escape once it has passed through them. Hawking postulated the existence of radiation that emits through a black hole. Now, this concept is famously known as Hawking radiation. 




A Black Hole Radiation Possibility of Extraterrestrial Life Fans did not appreciate Hawking just for his theories but also because he was a strong proponent of extraterrestrial life. It is said that Hawking believed that without qualification the balance of probability falls to extraterrestrial life. In fact, he strongly believed that the Earth had already been visited by extraterrestrial life. Now, that life was in the form of viruses or bacteria that Hawking enjoyed imagining. 




Possibility of Extraterrestrial LifeThe Big Bang Theory The Big Bang theory is a physical theory explained by none other than Stephen Hawking. This theory from Hawking describes how the whole universe expanded from an initial state to high density. On the other hand, the hypothesis in this theory states that all the matter in this universe came into existence at the same time. Now, the estimation of that could be 13.8 billion years ago. The Origination of Universe (The Theory of Everything)Stephen Hawking wrote this thesis in 1988. This theory from the world-famous physicist proposed that Steady State is the theory that is mathematically self-contradictory. Hawking explained in this theory that the whole universe started infinitely small. Now, over the years, that small unit became a larger density and he called it a singularity. This thesis is accepted by major universities and professors all over the world. Cosmic Inflation TheoryThis theory from Hawking was given in 1982. Physical cosmology, cosmological inflation, and inflation are all a theory of the exponential expansion of space in the early universe. Cosmic inflation is the concept of faster-than-light expansion that spawned many others in this universe.Stephen Hawking Discoveries List Some of the important discoveries or theories made by Stephen Hawking are explained above. Other important theories and discoveries made by Stephen Hawking are the following:Gravitational and Spacetime Singularities The Big Bang Theory Is the End in Sight for Theoretical Physics? Cosmological Inflation A brief History of Time Euclidean Quantum Gravity (Book)Black Holes and Baby Universes Interesting Facts About Stephen Hawking for Kids Hawking received the honorific CBE (Commander of the British Empire) in 1982 from the Queen.He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, which is the highest honour given to a civilian in the United States.Summary In this article, we have discussed the findings and discoveries of Stephen Hawking. We now know that he contributed a lot to science during his time. During his old age, Hawking continued writing for the young generation. His work toward society will always remain a godly gesture. Stephen Hawking not only gave theories but he had started planning for a trip to space. Unfortunately, that was not quite possible for him because of his disease. Moreover, the discoveries made by Stephen Hawking will always live within us throughout every generation. We hope you enjoyed reading this article, in case of any other doubts, feel free to ask in the comments.Recently Updated PagesGestation Period in Humans: Learn Definition, Properties and FactsMirage - An Illusion, Facts and ExamplesFacts About Albert EinsteinWhat are Common Ore Examples? | Types and Uses of OresImage of Heat - Understanding Heat Zones with an ImageSense of Smell for Kids | Learn Important Terms and ConceptsGestation Period in Humans: Learn Definition, Properties and FactsMirage - An Illusion, Facts and ExamplesFacts About Albert EinsteinWhat are Common Ore Examples? | Types and Uses of OresImage of Heat - Understanding Heat Zones with an ImageSense of Smell for Kids | Learn Important Terms and Concepts12Other PagesEnergy TransformationIsaac Newton ContributionUses of Meteorological InstrumentsUses of TreesPeriodic Table FactsBacteria: Parts of Bacteria and Interesting Facts about ThemEnergy TransformationIsaac Newton ContributionUses of Meteorological InstrumentsUses of TreesPeriodic Table FactsBacteria: Parts of Bacteria and Interesting Facts about Them12FAQs on Stephen Hawking Discoveries1.
