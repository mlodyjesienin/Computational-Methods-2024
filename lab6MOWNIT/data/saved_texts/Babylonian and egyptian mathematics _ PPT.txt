It describes how early mathematics developed out of practical needs in early civilizations along rivers like the Nile, Tigris, Euphrates, Indus, and Huangho. Archaeologists have uncovered hundreds of thousands of clay tablets in Mesopotamia containing early mathematical concepts. These include arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and early use of tables and formulas. Egyptian mathematics is also discussed and sources of early mathematical knowledge from Egypt are described, including papyri, monuments, and other inscriptions.Read lessRead moreReportShareReportShare1 of 38Download nowRecommendedAncient mathAncient mathSheena Joy Patoc History of MathematicsMathematics in Ancient GreeceMathematics in Ancient GreeceSugarShyneOtaza For school purposes only.Egyptian mathematicsEgyptian mathematicsMabdulhady Egyptian mathematics, how Egyptian mathematics discovered before more than 1400 year  B.C.HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS SLIDE PRESENTATION;ResmiHISTORY OF MATHEMATICS SLIDE PRESENTATION;ResmiResmi Nair mathematics is the mirror of civilization.learning history of mathematics is very essential.Sets of Axioms and Finite GeometriesSets of Axioms and Finite GeometriesSamuel John Parreño This is an introduction to Modern GeometryHistory Of MathematicsHistory Of MathematicsBennet Hailink All about how Number s were developed, Geometry, Arithematic Operations.

Dear Dr. Kornbluth and Mr. Gorenberg,
The US House of Representatives is deeply concerned by ongoing and pervasive acts of antisemitic 
harassment and intimidation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Failing to act decisively to ensure a safe learning environment for all students would be a grave dereliction of your responsibilities as President of MIT and Chair of the MIT Corporation. 
This Congress will not stand idly by and allow an environment hostile to Jewish students to persist. The House believes that your institution is in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the inability or 
unwillingness to rectify this violation through action requires accountability.
Postsecondary education is a unique opportunity for students to learn and have their ideas and beliefs challenged. However, universities receiving hundreds of millions of federal funds annually have denied 
students that opportunity and have been hijacked to become venues for the promotion of terrorism, antisemitic harassment and intimidation, unlawful encampments, and in some cases, assaults and riots. 
The House of Representatives will not countenance the use of federal funds to indoctrinate students into hateful, antisemitic, anti-American supporters of terrorism. Investigations into campus antisemitism by the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on Ways and Means have been expanded into a Congress-wide probe across all relevant jurisdictions to address this national crisis. The undersigned Committees will conduct oversight into the use of federal funds at MIT and its learning environment under authorities granted to each Committee.
• The Committee on Education and the Workforce has been investigating your institution since December 7, 2023. The Committee has broad jurisdiction over postsecondary education, including its compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, campus safety concerns over disruptions to the learning environment, and the awarding of federal student aid under the Higher Education Act.
• The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is investigating the sources of funding and other support flowing to groups espousing pro-Hamas propaganda and engaged in antisemitic harassment and intimidation of students. The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is the principal oversight committee of the US House of Representatives and has broad authority to investigate “any matter” at “any time” under House Rule X.
• The Committee on Ways and Means has been investigating several universities since November 15, 2023, when the Committee held a hearing entitled From Ivory Towers to Dark Corners: Investigating the Nexus Between Antisemitism, Tax-Exempt Universities, and Terror Financing. The Committee followed the hearing with letters to those institutions on January 10, 202S1-Introduction-Biopesticides in ICM.pptxS1-Introduction-Biopesticides in ICM.pptxtarandeep35 S1-Introduction-Biopesticides in ICMThesis Statement for students diagnonsed withADHD.pptThesis Statement for students diagnonsed withADHD.pptEverAndrsGuerraGuerr Presentation required for the master in Education.MATATAG CURRICULUM: ASSESSING THE READINESS OF ELEM.

PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS I...NelTorrente In this research, it concludes that while the readiness of teachers in Caloocan City to implement the MATATAG Curriculum is generally positive, targeted efforts in professional development, resource distribution, support networks, and comprehensive preparation can address the existing gaps and ensure successful curriculum implementation.A Strategic Approach: GenAI in EducationA Strategic Approach: GenAI in EducationPeter Windle Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as Generative AI, Image Generators and Large Language Models have had a dramatic impact on teaching, learning and assessment over the past 18 months. The most immediate threat AI posed was to Academic Integrity with Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) focusing their efforts on combating the use of GenAI in assessment. Guidelines were developed for staff and students, policies put in place too. Innovative educators have forged paths in the use of Generative AI for teaching, learning and assessments leading to pockets of transformation springing up across HEIs, often with little or no top-down guidance, support or direction.

This Gasta posits a strategic approach to integrating AI into HEIs to prepare staff, students and the curriculum for an evolving world and workplace. We will highlight the advantages of working with these technologies beyond the realm of teaching, learning and assessment by considering prompt engineering skills, industry impact, curriculum changes, and the need for staff upskilling. In contrast, not engaging strategically with Generative AI poses risks, including falling behind peers, missed opportunities and failing to ensure our graduates remain employable. The rapid evolution of AI technologies necessitates a proactive and strategic approach if we are to remain relevant.Azure Interview Questions and Answers PDF By ScholarHatAzure Interview Questions and Answers PDF By ScholarHatScholarhat Azure Interview Questions and Answers PDF By ScholarHatFresher’s Quiz 2023 at GMC Nizamabad.pptxFresher’s Quiz 2023 at GMC Nizamabad.pptxSriSurya50 General quiz conducted for freshers ,2k23 batch at Government Medical College,Nizamabad

 31. 2.8 ARITHMETIC AND  ALGEBRA
 Hieroglyphic Representation of Numbers
 Hieroglyphs are little pictures representing
words.
 The Egyptians had a bases 10 system of
hieroglyphs for numerals. By this we mean
that they has separate symbols for one unit,
one ten, one hundred, one thousand, one ten
thousand, one hundred thousand, and one
million.
 32. 2.8 ARITHMETIC AND  ALGEBRA
 Although the Egyptians had symbols
for numbers, they had no generally
uniform notation for arithmetical
operations. In the case of the famous
Rhind Papyrus (dating about 1650
B.C.),the scribe did represent addition
and subtraction by the hieroglyphs
and , which resemble the legs of
a person coming and going.
 33. 2.8 ARITHMETIC AND  ALGEBRA
 Multiplication is basically binary.
Example Multiply: 47 × 24
47 × 24
47 1
94 2
188 4
376 8 *
752 16 *
 Selecting 8 and 16 (i.e. 8 + 16 = 24), we have
24 = 16 + 8
47 × 24 = 47 × (16 + 8)
= 752 + 376
= 1128
 34. 2.8 ARITHMETIC AND  ALGEBRA
 Fractions
 The symbol for unit fractions was a flattened oval above the
denominator. In fact, this oval was the sign used by the Egyptians for
the mouth .
 For ordinary fractions, we have the following
1
24
1
7
1
3
 35. 2.8 ARITHMETIC AND  ALGEBRA
 Fractions
There were special symbols for the fractions
1/2 , 2/3 , 3/4.
 36. 2.8 ARITHMETIC AND  ALGEBRA
 Hieratic numerals
 37. 2.9 GEOMETRY
26 Of  the problems in the Moscow & Rhind papyri
are geometric.
 Computation of land area and granary volumes.
