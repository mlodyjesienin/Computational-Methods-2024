                $\sf MM^{++}$ is a 'good' set-theoretic axiom because it is 'Maximum'. Of course, bigger is better. But I'd like to know exactly how the argument works.
Let me be clear about the question posed:

Literature about formalization of "natural reasoning" in mathematical logic

In what sense does the sentence $\operatorname{con}(\mathsf{PA})$ "say" that $\mathsf{PA}$ is consistent?


                It seems common amongst logicians to think of "truth" as being relative to a particular structure. Consider, for instance, the first-order theory of groups. The sentence $\forall x\forall y(...

Is there any case of remormalization in which we have to solve it by ways in two different systems? [closed]


                In renormalization of physics, $$\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}j=-\frac{1}{12}$$ We may obtain the result in two ways: first we may redifine the sum so we have used two system of math with different definition ...

But causality per se is ...

Why is integer factoring hard while determining whether an integer is prime easy?


                In 2002, the discovery of the AKS algorithm proved that it is possible to determine whether an integer is prime in polynomial time deterministically. However, it is still not known whether there is an ...
