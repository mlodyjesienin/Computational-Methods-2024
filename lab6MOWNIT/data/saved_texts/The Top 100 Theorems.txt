The Top 100 Theorems


The Hundred Greatest Theorems



The millenium seemed to spur a lot of people to compile "Top 100" or "Best 100" lists of many things, including movies (by the American Film Institute) and books (by the Modern Library). Mathematicians were not immune, and at a mathematics conference in July, 1999, Paul and Jack Abad presented their list of "The Hundred Greatest Theorems."  Their ranking is based on the following criteria:  "the place the theorem holds in the literature, the quality of the proof, and the unexpectedness of the result." 

The list is of course as arbitrary as the movie and book list, but the
theorems here are all certainly worthy results.  I hope to over time
include links to the proofs of them all; for now, you'll have to content
yourself with the list itself and the biographies of the principals.
