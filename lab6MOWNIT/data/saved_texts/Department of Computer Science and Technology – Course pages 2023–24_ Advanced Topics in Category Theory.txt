Principal lecturer: Dr Jamie Vicary
Taken by: MPhil ACS, Part III
Code: L118
Term: Lent
Hours: 16
Prerequisites: Category Theory
Moodle, timetable
Teaching
The teaching style will be lecture-based, but supported by a
  practical component where students will learn to use a proof
  assistant for higher category theory, and build a small portfolio
  of proofs. Towards the end of the course we will explore some of
  the exciting computer science research literature on monoidal and
  higher categories, and students will choose a paper and present
  it to the class.
Aims
The module will introduce advanced topics in category theory.
  The aim is to train students to engage and start modern research
  on the mathematical foundations of higher categories, the
  graphical calculus, monoids and representations, type theories,
  and their applications in theoretical computer science, both
  classical and quantum.
Objectives
On completion of this module, students should:

Be familiar with the techniques of compositional category
    theory.
Have a strong understanding of basic categorical semantic
    models.
Begun exploring current research in monoidal categories and
    higher structures.

Syllabus
Part 1, lecture course:
  The first part of the course introduces concepts from monoidal
  categories and higher categories, and explores their application
  in computer science.
  ‐ Monoidal categories and the graphical calculus
  ‐ The proof assistant homotopy.io
  ‐ Coherence theorems and higher category theory
  ‐ Linearity, superposition, duality, quantum entanglement
  ‐ Monoids, Frobenius algebras and bialgebras
  ‐ Type theory for higher category theory
Part 2, exploring the research frontier:
  In the second part of the course, students choose a research
  paper to study, and give a presentation to the class.
  There is a nice varied literature related to the topics of the
  course, and the lecturer will supply a list of suggested
  papers. 
Classes
There will be four exercise sheets for homework, with
  accompanying classes by a teaching assistant to go over
  them.
Assessment

Problem sheets (50%)
Class presentation (20%)
