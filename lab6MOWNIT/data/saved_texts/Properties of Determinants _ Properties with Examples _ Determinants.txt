Properties of Determinants are the properties that are required to solve various problems in Matrices. There are various properties of the determinant that are based on the elements, rows, and columns of the determinant. These properties help us to easily find the value of the determinant. Suppose we have a matrix M = [aij] then the determinant of the matrix is denoted as, |M| or det M. 
There are various properties of the determinant of a matrix, and some of the important ones are, Reflection Property, Switching Property, Scalar Multiple Properties, Sum Property, Invariance Property, Factor Property, Triangle Property, Co-Factor Matrix Property, All-Zero Property, and Proportionality or Repetition Property.
In this article, we will learn about all the properties of the determinant with examples and others in detail.

Suppose we have a square matrix A of order 2, i.e.
A = [Tex]\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\ 
c & d
\end{pmatrix}





[/Tex]
Then determinant of A is defined as,
|A| = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix}
a & b\\ 
c & d
\end{vmatrix}





[/Tex]
|A| = ad – bc
This is the value of the determinant of matrix A, similarly, the determinant of all square matrices is calculated.

Properties of DeterminantsSome various rules and properties are used to easily find the value of the determinant which are called the Properties of Determinants. There are various properties of the determinant and some of the important ones are,
Triangle PropertyDeterminant of Cofactor MatrixFactor PropertyProperty of InvarianceScalar Multiple PropertyReflection PropertySwitching PropertyRepetition PropertyAll Zero PropertySum PropertyNow let’s learn about them in detail.
Properties of Determinants of a Matrix Explained The various properties of determinants of a Matrix are discussed in detail below:
1. Triangle PropertyThis property of the determinant states that if the elements above or below the main diagonal are zero, then the value of the determinant is equal to the product of the diagonal elements.
For any square matrix A such that,
A = [Tex]\begin{pmatrix}
a & 0 & o\\ 
d & e & 0\\
g & h & i\\
\end{pmatrix}





[/Tex]
|A| = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix}
a & 0 & o\\ 
d & e & 0\\
g & h & i\\
\end{vmatrix}





[/Tex]
Then according to Triangle Property of Determinant
|A| = a*e*i
2. Determinant of Cofactor MatrixFor any matrix square matrix A of order 2,
A = [Tex]\begin{pmatrix}
a & b\\ 
c & d
\end{pmatrix}





[/Tex]
Then determinant of A is defined as,
|A| = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix}
a & b\\ 
c & d
\end{vmatrix}





[/Tex]
Now suppose the cofactor matrix is, C then the determinant of cofactor matrix is,
|C| = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix}
C_{11} & C_{12}\\ 
C_{21} & C_{22}
\end{vmatrix}





[/Tex]
In the above matrix Cij denotes the cofacts of the respective elements of matrix A.
3. Factor PropertyFor any square matrix A of variable ‘x’ if on putting x = a the value of determinant is zero then, (x – a) is a factor of the determinant.
4. Property of InvarianceSuppose we have a square matrix A of order 3
A = [Tex]\begin{pmatrix}
a & b & c\\ 
d & e & f\\
g & h & i\\
\end{pmatrix}





[/Tex]
Then adding a scalar multiple of any row or column with the any row or column does not changes the value of determinant, i.e.
Ri → Ri + (q)Rj 
OR 
Ci → Ci + (q)Cj 
where, q represent the scalar constant, then the value of the determinant of the new matrix form does not changes.
|A|  = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix}
a & b & c\\ 
d & e & f\\
g & h & i\\
\end{vmatrix}





[/Tex]
|B| = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix}
a + qc & b & c\\ 
d + qf& e & f\\
g + qi& h & i\\
\end{vmatrix}





[/Tex]
Then the determinant of matrix A and matrix B are equal, i.e.
|A| = |B|
5. Scalar Multiple PropertyIf any row or column of a determinant, is multiplied by any scalar value, that is a non-zero constant, the entire determinant gets multiplied by the same scalar, that is, if any row or column is multiplied by constant k, the determinant value gets multiplied by k. Constants may be any real number.
Example:

Its determinant is |A| = 8 – 2 = 6
Let us multiply all the elements in the above matrix by 2.


|A| = 16 -4 = 12
You can see in the above example that after multiplying one row by a number 2, the determinant of the new matrix was also multiplied by the same number 2.
Let’s check for the correctness:
Original determinant = -10 and the new determinant = -5/2
So, (-5/2)/(-10) = 5/20 = 1/4
Again, (1/4) (-10) simplifies to -5/2.
Hence, the new determinant (-5/2) is equal to the original determinant (-10) multiplied by the scalar 1/4, which gives confirmation of the scalar multiple property.
=> New determinant=Original determinant × k
Therefore,
(Δ’) = 1/4 (Δ)
det(Δ’) = k det(Δ)
6. Transpose of Determinant (Reflection Property)Transpose refers to the operations of interchanging rows and columns of the determinant. The rows become columns and columns become rows in order. It is denoted by |AT|, for any determinant |A|.The property says determinant remains unchanged on its transpose, that is, |AT| = |A|.
Example:
|A| = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2\\ 3 & 4 & 5\\1&0&5\end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
|A| = -12
|AT| = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 3 & 1\\ 1 & 4 & 0\\2 & 5 & 5\end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
|AT| = -12
det(A) =  det(AT)
7. Switching PropertyIf we interchange any two rows/columns of the determinant, the magnitude (i.e. the sign) changes, but the determinant value remains the same.
Now,
Value of Determinant = (-1)number of exchanges
Example: Apply switching property in,
Δ = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2 & -4\\ -3 & 0 & 7\\0 & 5 & 1\end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
If we interchange C1 and C3, denoted by C1 ↔ C3
Δ’ = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} -4 & 2 & 1\\ 7 & 0 & -3\\1 & 5 & 0\end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
det (Δ) = -det(Δ’)
If we again interchange R1 and R2, denoted by R1 ↔ R2 
Δ” = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 7 & 0 & -3\\ -4 & 2 & 1\\1 & 5 & 0\end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
det(Δ”) = -det(Δ’) = det (Δ)
8. Repetition PropertyIf any pair of rows or columns of a determinant are exactly identical or proportion by same amount, then the determinant is zero.
9. All Zero PropertyIf all elements of any column or row are zero, then the determinant is zero
For any matrix,
A = [Tex]\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0\\ 
d & e & g\\
g & h & i\\
\end{pmatrix}



[/Tex]
⇒ |A| = 0
10. Sum PropertyIf all the elements of a row or columns in a determinant are expressed as a summation of two or more numbers, then the determinant can be broken down as a sum of corresponding smaller determinants.
We have, [Tex]\Delta = \begin{vmatrix} a + 5m & d & g\\ b + 7n & e & h\\ c + 3p & f & i \end{vmatrix}  







[/Tex]
Then, [Tex]\Delta = \begin{vmatrix} a & d & g\\ b & e & h\\ c & f & i \end{vmatrix} + \begin{vmatrix} 5m & d & g\\ 7n & e & h\\ 3p & f & i \end{vmatrix}







[/Tex]

Δ = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 5 & 2 & 3\\ 2 & 4 & 5\\ 1 & 8 & 7 \end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
k = 3/2
Solution:
Δ = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 5 & 2 & 3\\ 2 & 4 & 5\\ 1 & 8 & 7 \end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
det(Δ) = 5[(4×7) – (8×5)] – 2[(2×7) – (5×1)] + 3[(2×8) – (4×1)]
det(Δ) = -60 – 18 + 36
det(Δ) = -42
Now, on multiplying by k = 3/2, first column,
 Δ’ = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 5 & 2 & 3\\ 2 & 4 & 5\\ 1 & 8 & 7 \end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
Δ’ = [Tex]\begin{vmatrix} 15/2 & 2 & 3\\ 3 & 4 & 5\\ 3/2 & 8 & 7 \end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
det (Δ’) = -63
Therefore,
det(Δ’) = 3/2  det(Δ)
⇒ det(Δ’) = k det(Δ)

0 & 0 & 0\\
1 & 8 & 5\\
\end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
det(Δ) = 0 (since R2 ⇢0)

3 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
5 & 6 & 8 & 0\\
7 & 1 & 5 & 9
\end{vmatrix}


[/Tex]
det(Δ) = 2 × 1 × 8 × 9 
det(Δ) = 144
