An equation is basically a mathematical expression, equating two different quantities, values, or expressions. The main issue in this field of study is that an algebraic equation will have an algebraic solution. To put it simply, the idea of complex solutions was not common knowledge. Therefore, finding the solution to a single unknown variable in a non-linear polynomial equation was a stumbling block. Mathematician Evariste Galois was the first to solve this problem in the year 1830. His theory gave a distinct outline to help understand which equations could be solved by radical values. This is how the theory of equations became its own area rather than being synonymous with algebra itself.  Definition and Mathematical Theory of EquationsTheory of equations can be defined as the study of the different methods that can be implied to find out the unknown values and solve a mathematical equation.Mathematical Theory of Equation:A polynomial function or equation can be represented by the expression, $f(x)={{a}_{0}}{{x}^{n}}+{{a}_{1}}{{x}^{n-1}}+...+{{a}_{n}}$.Here, n is a non-negative integer and ${{a}_{i}}(i=0,1,...,n)$ are fixed complex numbers. The above expression in f will be termed a polynomial of x up to the nth degree. ${{a}_{1}},{{a}_{2}},...,{{a}_{n}}$ are termed as coefficients of the function $f$.This is the basic theory of equations behind the concept of the theory of equations.In the case of a quadratic equation, the general formula is given by $a{{x}^{2}}+bx+c=0$. (Here a,b,c are arbitrary constants of the equation).Every quadratic equation has two roots, which can be either real roots, or complex in nature. The discriminant of the quadratic equation is given by the expression, $D={{b}^{2}}-4ac$. The nature of the discriminant decides whether the equation will have two real roots, two equal roots or only complex roots. Key Points Regarding the Theory of EquationsTo summarise the important concepts and ideas related to the theory of equations, the following list can be helpful:The general mathematical formula for a quadratic equation in variable x is given by $a{{x}^{2}}+bx+c=0$.The roots of a quadratic equation are given by $x=-b\pm \dfrac{\sqrt{{{b}^{2}}-4ac}}{2a}$If $\alpha ,\beta$ are the two roots of the equation, then $\alpha +\beta =\dfrac{-b}{a}$ and $\alpha \cdot\beta =\dfrac{c}{a}$The discriminant of the quadratic equation is denoted by $D={{b}^{2}}-4ac$.When D = 0, the equation has two equal roots.When D > 0, the equation has two distinct real roots.When D < 0, the roots of the equation will be complex. The quadratic equation exhibits a parabolic graph which opens upwards if a > 0 and downwards if a < 0.At a > 0, the function f has the minimum value and when a < 0 the function has its maximum value.Solved Problems on Theory of Equations To understand better how this math theory is exactly applied, we will take the following examples.Problem 1: If the roots of the equation ${{x}^{3}}+p{{x}^{2}}+qx+r=0$ are in arithmetic progression, then prove that $2{{p}^{3}}-9pq+27r=0$Solution:Given equation, ${{x}^{3}}+p{{x}^{2}}+qx+r=0$. The roots of the equation are in arithmetic progression. Therefore, let the roots be a-d, a, a+d respectively.$\begin{align} & \therefore (-p)=a-d+a+a+d \\  & \Rightarrow -p=3a \\  & \Rightarrow a=\dfrac{-p}{3} \\ \end{align}$As a is one of the three roots of the given equation, it must satisfy the equation, ${{x}^{3}}+p{{x}^{2}}+qx+r=0$.Therefore, substituting x with $a=\dfrac{-p}{3}$, we get:${{\left( \dfrac{-p}{3} \right)}^{3}}+p{{\left( \dfrac{-p}{3} \right)}^{2}}+q\left( \dfrac{-p}{3} \right)+r=0$On simplification, we get , $2{{p}^{3}}\,-9pq+27r=0$.  Hence, proved.Problem 2: If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $2{{x}^{2}}+8x+k=0$, what is the maximum value of $\left[ \dfrac{\alpha }{\beta }+\dfrac{\beta }{\alpha } \right]$ when $k<0$.Theory:Comparing the quadratic equation, $2{{x}^{2}}+8x+k=0$ with $a{{x}^{2}}+bx+c=0$ we get,$a=\,2,\,b=\,8$ and $c=k$Let the roots of the given equation be $\alpha$ and $\beta$.Then sum of roots, $\alpha +\beta =-\,\dfrac{b}{a}$, $\therefore \,\,\alpha +\beta =-\dfrac{8}{2}=-\,4$ and,Product of roots is  $\alpha \bullet \beta =\,\dfrac{c}{a}$ Or $\alpha \bullet \beta =\dfrac{k}{2}$Discriminant, $D={{b}^{2}}-\,4ac=64-8k$. Now since, k < 0, $\therefore d=64-8k<0$. As the discriminant is less than zero, the roots of the equation are both real roots.Now, $\left[ \dfrac{\alpha }{\beta }+\dfrac{\beta }{\alpha } \right]=\left[ \dfrac{{{\alpha }^{2}}+{{\beta }^{2}}}{\alpha \beta } \right]=\left[ \dfrac{{{(\alpha +\beta )}^{2}}-2\alpha \beta }{\alpha \beta } \right]$$\Rightarrow \left[ \dfrac{\alpha }{\beta }+\dfrac{\beta }{\alpha } \right]=\left[ \dfrac{{{(\alpha +\beta )}^{2}}-2\alpha \beta }{\alpha \beta } \right]=\left[ \dfrac{{{(\alpha +\beta )}^{2}}}{\alpha \beta }-2 \right]$Substituting the values of $\alpha +\beta$ and $\alpha \beta$ in$\left[ \dfrac{{{(\alpha +\beta )}^{2}}}{\alpha \beta }-2 \right]$  we get,$\left[ \dfrac{\alpha }{\beta }+\dfrac{\beta }{\alpha } \right]\,\,=\,\,\left[ \dfrac{{{(-4)}^{2}}}{\left(\dfrac{k}{2}\right)}-2 \right]=\,\dfrac{32}{k}-\,2$ As, k < 0, therefore the maximum value of $\left[ \dfrac{\alpha }{\beta }+\dfrac{\beta }{\alpha } \right]=-2$.ConclusionThe theory of equations basically gives us the different methods that can be used to solve polynomial equations. A polynomial expression can either be linear or nonlinear. The general formula of a quadratic function in x is given by $a{{x}^{2}}+bx+c=0$ and the discriminant the discriminant is given by D, such that $D={{b}^{2}}-4ac$ . The discriminant decides the nature of the roots. The roots of a quadratic equation can either be equal, real or complex. The sum of the roots of the equation gives us the value of $\dfrac{-b}{a}$ and the product of the roots gives us the value of $\dfrac{c}{a}$.Popular Vedantu Learning Centres Near YouMithanpura, MuzaffarpurVedantu Learning Centre, 2nd Floor, Ugra Tara Complex, Club Rd, opposite Grand Mall, Mahammadpur Kazi, Mithanpura, Muzaffarpur, Bihar 842002Visit CentreAnna Nagar, ChennaiVedantu Learning Centre, Plot No. Y - 217, Plot No 4617, 2nd Ave, Y Block, Anna Nagar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600040Visit CentreVelachery, ChennaiVedantu Learning Centre, 3rd Floor, ASV Crown Plaza, No.391, Velachery - Tambaram Main Rd, Velachery, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600042Visit CentreTambaram, ChennaiShree Gugans School CBSE, 54/5, School road, Selaiyur, Tambaram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600073Visit CentreAvadi, ChennaiVedantu Learning Centre, Ayyappa Enterprises - No: 308 / A CTH Road Avadi, Chennai - 600054Visit CentreDeeksha Vidyanagar, BangaloreSri Venkateshwara Pre-University College, NH 7, Vidyanagar, Bengaluru International Airport Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka 562157Visit CentreView MoreCompetitive Exams after 12th ScienceRecently Updated PagesDetermining Molecular Masses Using Victor Meyer’s MethodCoulomb's Law - History, Formula, Conditions , Limitations and Important FAQsNuclear Stability and Binding Energy Curve Important Concepts for JEEDifference Between Two Stroke and Four Stroke Engines: JEE Main 2024Self Inductance – Definition, Formula, Unit and FAQsContinuous X-ray – Definition and CharacteristicsDetermining Molecular Masses Using Victor Meyer’s MethodCoulomb's Law - History, Formula, Conditions , Limitations and Important FAQsNuclear Stability and Binding Energy Curve Important Concepts for JEEDifference Between Two Stroke and Four Stroke Engines: JEE Main 2024Self Inductance – Definition, Formula, Unit and FAQsContinuous X-ray – Definition and Characteristics12Other PagesMoment of Inertia of a SquareLigands and Their Types for IIT JEEHybridization of NO2  (Nitrogen Dioxide)MutarotationMotion Under Gravity – Equation of Motion with ExamplesDiscovery of Electron, Proton and Neutron for IIT JEEMoment of Inertia of a SquareLigands and Their Types for IIT JEEHybridization of NO2  (Nitrogen Dioxide)MutarotationMotion Under Gravity – Equation of Motion with ExamplesDiscovery of Electron, Proton and Neutron for IIT JEE12FAQs on Theory of Equations - JEE Important Topic1. Who is the father of the theory of equations?The algebraic theory of equations developed over a long period of time. Initially, equations were synonymous with algebra, and it took time and effort to distinguish between the two fields. In the 1800s, Niels Henrik Abel first proved that some 5th degree equations remained unsolved. 

In 1830, Evariste Galois expounded the Galois theory. That being said, there is no single person who has the credit for establishing this particular field of mathematics. Thus, we can see that the theory of equations developed over a period of time and there are different contributions made by mathematicians and scientists. 2. What is the relation between the roots and coefficient of a quadratic equation?The roots of a quadratic equation are the two solutions of the variable in the given equation. The roots of a quadratic equation gives us the points of intersection of the parabolic curve traced by the equation and the axis of the said parabola. For a quadratic equation of form $ax^2+ bx + c = 0$ with roots $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the sum of roots will be negative of the coefficient of the second term i.e. b divided by coefficient of first term i.e. a and the product of roots will be the third term divided by the coefficient of the first term i.e. $\alpha \beta =\dfrac{c}{a}$.JEE students also checkJEE Main OverviewJEE Main SyllabusJEE Main Question PapersJEE Main Study MaterialJEE Main ResultJEE Main CutoffJEE Main FAQJEE Main NewsJEE Advanced OverviewJEE Advanced SyllabusJEE Advanced Question PapersJEE Advanced Study MaterialJEE Advanced ResultJEE Advanced CutoffJEE Advanced FAQJEE Main & Advanced IIT CollegesStudy materialNCERTNCERTNCERT SolutionsNCERT Solutions for Class 12NCERT Solutions for Class 12 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 PhysicsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 ChemistryNCERT Solutions for Class 12 BiologyNCERT Solutions for Class 12 Business StudiesNCERT Solutions for Class 12 EconomicsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 AccountancyNCERT Solutions for Class 12 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 12 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 11NCERT Solutions for Class 11 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 PhysicsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 ChemistryNCERT Solutions for Class 11 BiologyNCERT Solutions for Class 11 Business StudiesNCERT Solutions for Class 11 EconomicsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 AccountancyNCERT Solutions for Class 11 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 11 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 10NCERT Solutions for Class 10 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 10 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 10 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 10 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 10 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 9NCERT Solutions for Class 9 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 9 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 9 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 9 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 9 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 8NCERT Solutions for Class 8 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 8 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 8 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 8 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 8 HindiNCERT BooksNCERT Books Class 12NCERT Books Class 11NCERT Books Class 10NCERT Books Class 9NCERT Books Class 8Reference book solutionsReference Book SolutionsHC Verma SolutionsRD Sharma SolutionsRS Aggarwal SolutionsNCERT Exemplar SolutionsLakhmir Singh SolutionsDK Goel SolutionsTS Grewal  SolutionsSandeep GargCompetitive ExamsCompetitive ExamsJEE MainJEE AdvancedNEETOlympiad PreparationNDAKVPYNTSECBSECBSECBSE SyllabusCBSE Sample PaperCBSE WorksheetsCBSE Important QuestionsCBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10CBSE Important FormulasICSEICSEICSE SolutionsICSE Class 10 SolutionsICSE Class 9 SolutionsICSE Class 8 Solutions State boardsState BoardsAP BoardBihar BoardGujarat BoardKarnataka BoardKerala BoardMaharashtra BoardMP BoardRajasthan BoardTelangana BoardTN BoardUP BoardWB BoardFree Study MaterialFree Study MaterialPrevious Year Question PapersSample PapersJEE Main Study MaterialsJEE Advanced Study MaterialsNEET Study MaterialsOlympiad Study MaterialsKids LearningAsk QuestionsImportant SubjectsPhysicsBiologyChemistryMathsEnglishCommerceGeographyCivicsRevision NotesRevision NotesCBSE Class 12 NotesCBSE Class 11 NotesCBSE Class 10 NotesCBSE Class 9 NotesCBSE Class 8 Notes JEE MAINJEE MainJEE Main Important QuestionsJEE Main Important ChaptersJEE Main NotesJEE Main FormulasJEE Main Difference betweenJEE Main SyllabusJEE Main Physics SyllabusJEE Main Mathematics SyllabusJEE Main Chemistry SyllabusJEE Main Previous Year Question PaperJEE ADVANCEDJEE AdvancedJEE Advanced Important QuestionsJEE Advanced Important ChaptersJEE Advanced NotesJEE Advanced FormulasJEE Advanced Difference betweenJEE Advanced SyllabusJEE Advanced Physics SyllabusJEE Advanced Mathematics SyllabusJEE Advanced Chemistry SyllabusJEE Advanced Previous Year Question Paper NEETNEETNEET Important QuestionsNEET Important ChaptersNEET NotesNEET DiagramsNEET Difference betweenNEET SyllabusNEET Physics SyllabusNEET Chemistry SyllabusNEET Biology SyllabusNEET Previous Year Question Paper OFFLINE CENTRESMuzaffarpurChennaiBangalorePatialaDelhiHyderabadVijayawadaVisakhapatnamTiruchirapalliMadurai CoimbatorePuneNagpurGunturAurangabadRaipurBhilaiBilaspurSrinagarJammuBhubaneswarJhunjhunu © 2024.Vedantu.com.
