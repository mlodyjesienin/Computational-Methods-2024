Developments in the mathematical and statistical sciences are critical to the latest advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Join the National Academies for a virtual symposium on Thursday, November 11 from 2-4pm ET to discuss new innovations and future opportunities for mathematical research.
During the symposium, speakers will discuss how statistical theory helps build in protections for black box machine learning models, new approaches for making sense of high-dimensional and heterogenous data, novel methods for understanding causality, and future research opportunities in deep learning.
Sponsor: National Academies
Date/Time: 
Nov 11 2021 - 2:00pm to 4:00pm
