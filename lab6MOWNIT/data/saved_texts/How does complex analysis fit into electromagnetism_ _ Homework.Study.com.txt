					How does complex analysis fit into electromagnetism?





Question:

How does complex analysis fit into electromagnetism?

Electromagnetism:
Electromagnetism is the process where the magnetic effect is applied in electric conductors. It is applied in everyday life; thus, it is important to study it; for instance, it elaborates on the mechanism in which electric current travels in generators to the point where a bulb is lit.
