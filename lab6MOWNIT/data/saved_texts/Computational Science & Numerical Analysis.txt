Computational Science & Numerical Analysis
Computational science is a key area related to physical mathematics.  The problems 
of interest in physical mathematics often require computations for their resolution. 
Conversely, the development of efficient computational algorithms often requires an 
understanding of the basic properties of the solutions to the equations to be solved 
numerically.  For example, the development of methods for the solution of hyperbolic 
equations (e.g. shock capturing methods in, say, gas-dynamics) has been characterized 
by a very close interaction between theoretical, computational, experimental 
scientists, and engineers.
