Experiments proving existence of atomic nuclei
A replica of an apparatus used by Geiger and Marsden to measure alpha particle scattering in a 1913 experiment.
The Rutherford scattering experiments were a landmark series of experiments by which scientists learned  that every atom has a nucleus where all of its positive charge and most of its mass is concentrated.  They deduced this after measuring how an alpha particle beam is scattered when it strikes a thin metal foil. The experiments were performed between 1906 and 1913 by Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden under the direction of Ernest Rutherford at the Physical Laboratories of the University of Manchester. The most crucial of these experiments was performed in 1909, being the one where they discovered angles of scattering greater than 90 degrees.


Summary[edit]
Thomson's model of the atom[edit]
The "plum pudding model" of the atom, this one having seven electrons, as imagined by J. J. Thomson in 1905.
The prevailing model of atomic structure before Rutherford's experiments was devised by J. J. Thomson. Thomson had discovered the electron through his work on cathode rays[1] and concluded that an electric current is electrons flowing from one atom to an adjacent atom in a series. When no electric current is in effect, electrons remain embedded within atoms. To explain why atoms are electrically neutral, he proposed the existence of a commensurate amount of positive charge that balanced the negative charge of the electrons. Having no idea what was the source of this positive charge, he tentatively proposed that the positive charge was everywhere in the atom, the atom being spherical in shape.[2] Thomson thought of the positive sphere as being akin to a liquid in that the electrons could freely move about in it, their arrangement and movements being determined by the balance of electrostatic forces.
Thomson was not quite satisfied with this simplistic idea and hoped to dispense with it as he refined his model.[3] Thomson's model of the atom is popularly referred to as the plum pudding model, although neither Thomson nor his colleagues ever used this analogy.[4]
Thomson's model was not universally accepted even before Rutherford's experiments. Thomson was never able to develop a complete and stable model that could predict any of the other known properties of the atom, such as emission spectra and valencies.[5] The Japanese scientist Hantaro Nagaoka rejected Thomson's model on the grounds that opposing charges cannot penetrate each other.[6] He proposed instead that electrons orbit the positive charge like the rings around Saturn.[7]

Alpha particles and the Thomson atom[edit]
An alpha particle is a tiny positively charged particle of matter that is spontaneously emitted from certain radioactive elements. Alpha particles are so small as to be invisible, but their presence can be detected with the use of phosphorescent screens, photographic plates, or electrodes. Rutherford discovered them in 1899,[8] and in 1906, by studying how alpha particle beams are deflected by magnetic and electric fields, he deduced that they were essentially helium atoms stripped of their electrons because they had the same charge-to-mass ratio and atomic weight.[9] Protons and neutrons had yet to be discovered, so Rutherford knew nothing about the structure of alpha particles.
According to Thomson's model, if an alpha particle were to collide with an atom, it would just fly straight through, its path being deflected by at most a fraction of a degree. At the atomic scale, the concept of "solid matter" is meaningless. The Thomson atom is a sphere of electric charges anchored in space by its mass, with mass by definition being resistance to acceleration. Thus the alpha particle will not bounce off the atom like a tennis ball hitting a basketball, but will pass through if the electric fields are weak enough to permit it. The sphere of positive charge is too diffuse to significantly deflect the alpha particle, and the electrons likewise cannot produce significant deflection because they are too lightweight.

Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden[edit]
Ernest RutherfordHans GeigerErnest Marsden
Ernest Rutherford was Langworthy Professor of Physics at the Victoria University of Manchester[10]: 188  (now the University of Manchester).  He had already received numerous honours for his studies of radiation.  He had discovered the existence of alpha rays, beta rays, and gamma rays, and had proved that these were the consequence of the disintegration of atoms. In 1906, he received a visit from a German physicist named Hans Geiger, and was so impressed that he asked Geiger to stay and help him with his research.[11] Ernest Marsden was a physics undergraduate student studying under Geiger.
In 1908, Rutherford sought to independently determine the charge and mass of alpha particles. To do this, he wanted to count the number of alpha particles and measure their total charge; the ratio would give the charge of a single alpha particle. Alpha particles are so tiny as to be individually invisible, but Rutherford knew that alpha particles ionize air molecules, and if the air is within a strong electric field, each ion will produce a cascade of ions giving a pulse of electric current. On this principle, Rutherford and Geiger designed a simple counting device which consisted of two electrodes in a glass tube. (See #1908 experiment.) Every alpha particle that passed through the tube would create a pulse of electricity that could be counted. It was an early version of the Geiger counter.[12]: 258 
The counter that Geiger and Rutherford built proved unreliable because the alpha particles were being too strongly deflected by their collisions with the molecules of air within the detection chamber. The highly variable trajectories of the alpha particles meant that they did not all generate the same number of ions as they passed through the gas, thus producing erratic readings.  This puzzled Rutherford because he had thought that alpha particles were just too heavy to be deflected so strongly. Rutherford asked Geiger to investigate just how far matter could scatter alpha rays.[13]
The experiments they designed involved bombarding a metal foil with a beam of alpha particles to observe how the foil scattered them in relation to its thickness and material. They used a phosphorescent screen to measure the trajectories of the particles.  Each impact of an alpha particle on the screen produced a tiny flash of light. Geiger worked in a darkened lab for hours on end, counting these tiny scintillations using a microscope.[14] Rutherford lacked the patience for this work.[15] For the metal foil, they tested a variety of metals, but they favored gold because they could make the foil very thin, as gold is the most malleable metal.[16]  As a source of alpha particles, Rutherford's substance of choice was radon, a substance several million times more radioactive than uranium.
The experiments did not go smoothly. The angular spread of the particle on the screen varied greatly with the shape of the apparatus and its internal pressure. Rutherford suggested that Marsden should look for diffusely reflected or back-scattered alpha particles, even though these were not expected. Marsden's first crude reflector got results, so Geiger helped him create a more sophisticated apparatus. They were able to demonstrate that 1 in 8000 alpha particle collisions were diffuse reflections. Although this fraction was small, it was much larger than what the Thomson model of the atom could explain.[12]: 264  This  critical experiment was published in 1909.[17]

The outcome of the experiments[edit]
Left: Had Thomson's model been correct, all the alpha particles should have passed through the foil with minimal scattering.Right: What Geiger and Marsden observed was that a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced strong deflection.
Rutherford worked for almost 2 years before publishing his landmark 1911 paper with a new model for the atom.[12] 
They had discovered that the metal foils could scatter some alpha particles in all directions, sometimes more than 90 degrees. This should have been impossible according to Thomson's model; it relied on electron scattering and the electrons are too light to turn the heavier alpha particle to the side. This forced Rutherford to revise the model of the atom. In the Thomson model, the atom is effectively uniformly neutral in charge because the electrons and the positive charge are more or less evenly mixed. Rutherford conceived a new model in which the negative and positive charges were segregated, the positive charge being in a tiny nucleus and the electrons swarming about in the form a diffuse cloud of negative charge.[10]: 191  It was this nucleus ten thousand times smaller than the atom's overall size but containing all of the positive charge and almost all of the mass, that caused the extreme scattering of the alpha particle beam. The diffuse electron cloud that surrounds the nucleus can be neglected since the alpha particle penetrates very close to the tiny nucleus.[18]: 382 

Legacy[edit]
Main articles: Rutherford model and Rutherford–Bohr model
For the most part Rutherford's atomic model was completely ignored immediately after it was published. The probability techniques he used and confusing collection of observations involved were not immediately compelling.[12]: 304  This all changed once Niels Bohr arrived as a post-doctoral student in Manchester at Rutherford's invitation. He dropped his work on the Thomson model in favor of Rutherford's nuclear model, developing the Rutherford–Bohr model over the next several years.
Hantaro Nagaoka, who had once proposed a Saturnian model of the atom, wrote to Rutherford from Tokyo in 1911: "I have been struck with the simpleness of the apparatus you employ and the brilliant results you obtain."[19]
The astronomer Arthur Eddington called Rutherford's discovery the most important scientific achievement since Democritus proposed the atom ages earlier.[20] Rutherford has since been hailed as "the father of nuclear physics".
In a lecture delivered on October 15, 1936 at Cambridge University,[21][22] Rutherford commented on his reaction to the results of the 1909 experiment (see below for details):

Then I remember two or three days later Geiger coming to me in great excitement and saying, "We have been able to get some of the α-particles coming backwards...". It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you. On consideration, I realized that this scattering backward must be the result of a single collision, and when I made calculations I saw that it was impossible to get anything of that order of magnitude unless you took a system in which  the greater part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a minute nucleus. It was then that I had the idea of an atom with a minute massive centre, carrying a charge.[23]
According to classical Newtonian physics, Rutherford's model of the atom is impossible. Accelerating charged particles radiate electromagnetic waves, so an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus in theory would spiral into the nucleus as it loses energy. Obviously this was not happening, which meant that the classic laws of physics do not apply at the atomic scale. This eventually led Niels Bohr to incorporate quantum mechanics into the model of the atom. These developments came roughly at the same time Albert Einstein produced his theory of general relativity, which showed that the classic laws of physics do not apply at the cosmic scale either.

The experiments[edit]
The 1906 experiment[edit]
In 1906, Rutherford noticed that alpha particles passing through sheets of mica were deflected by the sheets by as much as 2 degrees. Rutherford placed a radioactive source in a sealed tube ending with a narrow slits followed by a photographic plate. Half of the slit was covered by a thin layer of mica. A magnetic field around the tube was altered every 10 minutes to reject the effect of beta rays, known to be sensitive to magnetic fields.[24] The tube was evacuated to different amounts and a series of images recorded. At the lowest pressure the image of the open slit was clear, while images of the mica covered slit or the open slit at higher pressures was fuzzy. Rutherford explained these results as alpha-particle scattering[12]: 260  in a paper published in 1906.[25]

The 1908 experiment[edit]


This apparatus was described in a 1908 paper by Hans Geiger.  It could only measure deflections of a few degrees.
A 1908 paper by Geiger, On the Scattering of α-Particles by Matter, describes the following experiment. He constructed a long glass tube, nearly two meters in length.  At one end of the tube was a quantity of "radium emanation" (R) that served as a source of alpha particles.  The opposite end of the tube was covered with a phosphorescent screen (Z).  In the middle of the tube was a 0.9 mm-wide slit.  The alpha particles from R passed through the slit and created a glowing patch of light on the screen.  A microscope (M) was used to count the scintillations on the screen and measure their spread.  Geiger pumped all the air out of the tube so that the alpha particles would be unobstructed, and they left a neat and tight image on the screen that corresponded to the shape of the slit.  Geiger then allowed some air in the tube, and the glowing patch became more diffuse.  Geiger then pumped out the air and placed some metal foil over the slit at AA, either gold or aluminium.  This too caused the patch of light on the screen to become more spread out.  This experiment demonstrated that both air and solid matter could markedly scatter alpha particles.[26]  The apparatus, however, could only observe small angles of deflection.  Rutherford wanted to know if the alpha particles were being scattered by even larger angles—perhaps larger than 90°.


The 1909 experiment[edit]


In these experiments, alpha particles emitted by a radioactive source (A) were observed bouncing off a metal reflector (R) and onto a fluorescent screen (S) on the other side of a lead plate (P).
In a 1909 paper, On a Diffuse Reflection of the α-Particles,[17] Geiger and Marsden described the experiment by which they proved that alpha particles can indeed be scattered by more than 90°. In their experiment, they prepared a small conical glass tube (AB) containing "radium emanation" (radon), "radium A" (actual radium), and "radium C" (bismuth-214); its open end sealed with mica.  This was their alpha particle emitter.  They then set up a lead plate (P), behind which they placed a fluorescent screen (S).  The tube was held on the opposite side of plate, such that the alpha particles it emitted could not directly strike the screen.  They noticed a few scintillations on the screen because some alpha particles got around the plate by bouncing off air molecules.  They then placed a metal foil (R) to the side of the lead plate. They tested with lead, gold, tin, aluminum, copper, silver, iron, and platinum. They pointed the tube at the foil to see if the alpha particles would bounce off it and strike the screen on the other side of the plate, and observed an increase in the number of scintillations on the screen. Counting the scintillations, they observed that metals with higher atomic mass, such as gold, reflected more alpha particles than lighter ones such as aluminium.[17]
Geiger and Marsden then wanted to estimate the total number of alpha particles that were being reflected.  The previous setup was unsuitable for doing this because the tube contained several radioactive substances (radium plus its decay products) and thus the alpha particles emitted had varying ranges, and because it was difficult for them to ascertain at what rate the tube was emitting alpha particles.  This time, they placed a small quantity of radium C (bismuth-214) on the lead plate, which bounced off a platinum reflector (R) and onto the screen.  They found that only a tiny fraction of the alpha particles that struck the reflector bounced onto the screen (in this case, 1 in 8,000).[17]


The 1910 experiment[edit]
This apparatus was described in 1910 paper by Geiger.  It was designed to precisely measure how the scattering varied according to the substance and thickness of the foil.
A 1910 paper[27] by Geiger, The Scattering of the α-Particles by Matter, describes an experiment by which he sought to measure how the most probable angle through which an alpha particle is deflected varies with the material it passes through, the thickness of said material, and the velocity of the alpha particles. He constructed an airtight glass tube from which the air was pumped out.  At one end was a bulb (B) containing "radium emanation" (radon-222).  By means of mercury, the radon in B was pumped up the narrow glass pipe whose end at A was plugged with mica.  At the other end of the tube was a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S).  The microscope which he used to count the scintillations on the screen was affixed to a vertical millimeter scale with a vernier, which allowed Geiger to precisely measure where the flashes of light appeared on the screen and thus calculate the particles' angles of deflection. The alpha particles emitted from A was narrowed to a beam by a small circular hole at D.  Geiger placed a metal foil in the path of the rays at D and E to observe how the zone of flashes changed. He tested gold, tin, silver, copper, and aluminium. He could also vary the velocity of the alpha particles by placing extra sheets of mica or aluminium at A.[27]
From the measurements he took, Geiger came to the following conclusions:

the most probable angle of deflection increases with the thickness of the material
the most probable angle of deflection is proportional to the atomic mass of the substance
the most probable angle of deflection decreases with the velocity of the alpha particles
the probability that a particle will be deflected by more than 90° is vanishingly small



Rutherford's Structure of the Atom paper (1911)[edit]


Main article: Rutherford scattering
Considering the results of the above experiments, Rutherford published a landmark paper in 1911 titled "The Scattering of α and β Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom" wherein he showed that single scattering from a very small and intense electric charge predicts primarily small-angle scattering with small but measurable amounts of backscattering.[18] For the purpose of his mathematical calculations he assumed this central charge was positive, but he admitted he could not prove this and that he had to wait for other experiments to develop his theory.
Rutherford developed a mathematical equation that modeled how the foil should scatter the alpha particles if all the positive charge and most of the atomic mass was concentrated in a point at the center of an atom.

From the scattering data, Rutherford estimated the central charge qn to be about +100 units[18]
Rutherford's paper does not discuss any electron arrangement beyond discussions on the scattering from JJ Thomson's plum pudding model and from Hantaro Nagaoka's Saturnian model.[12]: 303  He shows that the scattering results predicted by Thomson's model are also explained by single scattering, but that Thomson's model does not explain large angle scattering. He says that Nagaoka's model, having a compact charge, would agree with the scattering data. The Saturnian model had previously been rejected on other grounds. The so-called Rutherford model of the atom with orbiting electrons was not proposed by Rutherford in the 1911 paper.[12]: 304 

The 1913 experiment[edit]
In a 1913 paper, The Laws of Deflexion of α Particles through Large Angles,[28] Geiger and Marsden describe a series of experiments by which they sought to experimentally verify the above equation that Rutherford developed.  Rutherford's equation predicted that the number of scintillations per minute s that will be observed at a given angle Φ should be proportional to:

cosec4Φ/2
thickness of foil t
magnitude of the square of central charge Qn
1/(mv2)2
Their 1913 paper describes four experiments by which they proved each of these four relationships.

This apparatus was designed to accurately measure the scattering pattern of the alpha particles produced by the metal foil (F). The microscope (M) and screen (S) were affixed to a rotating cylinder and could be moved in a full circle around the foil.[28]
To test how the scattering varied with the angle of deflection (i.e. if s ∝ csc4Φ/2). Geiger and Marsden built an apparatus that consisted of a hollow metal cylinder mounted on a turntable.  Inside the cylinder was a metal foil (F) and a radiation source containing radon (R), mounted on a detached column (T) which allowed the cylinder to rotate independently.  The column was also a tube by which air was pumped out of the cylinder.  A microscope (M) with its objective lens covered by a fluorescent zinc sulfide screen (S) penetrated the wall of the cylinder and pointed at the metal foil. They tested with silver and gold foils. By turning the table, the microscope could be moved a full circle around the foil, allowing Geiger to observe and count alpha particles deflected by up to 150°. Correcting for experimental error, Geiger and Marsden found that the number of alpha particles that are deflected by a given angle Φ is indeed proportional to csc4Φ/2.[28]

This apparatus was used to measure how the scattering pattern varied in relation to the thickness of the foil, the atomic weight of the material, and the velocity of the alpha particles.  The rotating disc in the center had six holes which could be covered with foil.[28]
Geiger and Marsden then tested how the scattering varied with the thickness of the foil (i.e. if s ∝ t). They constructed a disc (S) with six holes drilled in it.  The holes were covered with metal foil (F) of varying thickness, or none for control.  This disc was then sealed in a brass ring (A) between two glass plates (B and C).  The disc could be rotated by means of a rod (P) to bring each window in front of the alpha particle source (R). On the rear glass pane was a zinc sulfide screen (Z). Geiger and Marsden found that the number of scintillations that appeared on the zinc sulfide screen was indeed proportional to the thickness as long as said thickness was small.[28]
Geiger and Marsden reused the above apparatus to measure how the scattering pattern varied with the square of the nuclear charge (i.e. if s ∝ Qn2).  Geiger and Marsden did not know what the positive charge of the nucleus of their metals were (they had only just discovered the nucleus existed at all), but they assumed it was proportional to the atomic weight, so they tested whether the scattering was proportional to the atomic weight squared. Geiger and Marsden covered the holes of the disc with foils of gold, tin, silver, copper, and aluminum. They measured each foil's stopping power by equating it to an equivalent thickness of air. They counted the number of scintillations per minute that each foil produced on the screen. They divided the number of scintillations per minute by the respective foil's air equivalent, then divided again by the square root of the atomic weight (Geiger and Marsden knew that for foils of equal stopping power, the number of atoms per unit area is proportional to the square root of the atomic weight). Thus, for each metal, Geiger and Marsden obtained the number of scintillations that a fixed number of atoms produce. For each metal, they then divided this number by the square of the atomic weight, and found that the ratios were more or less the same.  Thus they proved that s ∝ Qn2.[28]
Finally, Geiger and Marsden tested how the scattering varied with the velocity of the alpha particles (i.e. if s ∝ 1/v4).  Using the same apparatus again, they slowed the alpha particles by placing extra sheets of mica in front of the alpha particle source.  They found that, within the range of experimental error, that the number of scinitillations was indeed proportional to 1/v4.[28]


Rutherford determines the nucleus is positively charged[edit]
In his 1911 paper (see above), Rutherford assumed that the central charge of the atom was positive, but a negative charge would have fitted his scattering model just as well.[29]  In a 1913 paper,[30] Rutherford declared that the "nucleus" (as he now called it) was indeed positively charged, based on the result of experiments exploring the scattering of alpha particles in various gases.
In 1917, Rutherford and his assistant William Kay began exploring the passage of alpha particles through gases such as hydrogen and nitrogen. In an experiment where they shot a beam of alpha particles through hydrogen, but carefully prevented the alpha particles from reaching their detector, they observed particles nevertheless. Rutherford interpreted this as alpha particles knock the hydrogen nuclei forwards in the direction of the beam, not backwards.[29]

A simplistic mathematical look at the Thomson model[edit]
The mathematics that Thomson and Rutherford used in their papers may be rather complex for the layman, so in this section we will look at a very simplified set of equations that approximate the scattering pattern of alpha particles with the Thomson model.

Maximum possible deflection[edit]
Consider a single alpha particle passing by a gold atom. The atom is electrically neutral overall, but in this calculation we shall isolate the effect of the positive sphere by removing the electrons from the model. The alpha particle will experience maximum deflection if it just grazes the edge of the positive sphere because that is where the electric field is at its strongest. If the alpha particle were to pass through the sphere, not all of its positive charge would be pushing it out.

In the impulse model the average repelling force is applied for a time where that force is large.  The alpha particle's lateral change in momentum Δpy can be approximated using the Coulomb force over the distance equal to the radius of the atom applied just for the time the alpha particle passes, 2r⁄v:[31]

Because the gold atom is nearly 50 times as heavy as the alpha particle, we can treat it as having infinite mass. In his 1911 paper, Rutherford discusses the effects of lighter nuclei, using aluminum as his example, to show how the atomic weight of an atom affects the scattering.[18]: 385 
With this approximation we can show that for the alpha particle to be deflected by more than one degree, the radius of the sphere r would have to be several orders of magnitude smaller.
This simplistic formula is only accurate for angles of deflection of up to 20 degrees or so. The true size of the positive sphere in a gold atom, i.e. the nucleus, is 7×10−15 m, but if we used this as a value for r then θ becomes 81.5 degrees, which is large but inaccurate; the true value is actually 147 degrees. See the #General_mathematical_description_of_the_scattering section of this article for a more complex general solution.

Direct collision[edit]
Now consider an alpha particle passing through the middle of the same atom.

As the alpha particle approaches the center of the atom, the atom's electric field pushes back on it.  If the alpha particle passes the center of the atom, the atom will then start pushing the alpha particle forwards instead of back.
Let x be the distance between the alpha particle and the center of the atom. The amount of work that the atom exerts on the alpha particle up to the point that they make contact (ie when x ≥ r) will at most be

which is several orders of magnitude more than the work exerted by the atom's electric field. The Thomson atom thus cannot bring the alpha particle to a halt, never mind send it flying backwards.

Historical measurements of the variables[edit]
Rutherford assumed the radius of atoms in general to be on the order of 10−10 m. Rutherford assumed the positive charge of a gold atom to be about 100 times that of hydrogen (100 e).[18] He knew that gold has an atomic weight of 197. From an experiment in 1906, Rutherford measured alpha particles to have a charge of 2 e and an atomic weight of 4, and alpha particles emitted by radon to have a speed of 1.70×107 m/s.[33] In 1898, J. J. Thomson measured the charge on an electron to be about -2×10−19 C.[34] In 1909, Robert Millikan provided a more accurate measurement of the electron's charge at -1.59×10−19 C. Jean Perrin measured the mass of the hydrogen atom to be 1.49×10−27 kg, and if alpha particle are four times as heavy as that, they would have a mass of 5.96×10−27 kg.

General mathematical description of the scattering[edit]
For all these calculations we use the following values:

qg = positive charge of the gold atom = 79 e = 1.26×10−17 C
qa = charge of the alpha particle = 2 e = 3.20×10−19 C
r = radius of the gold atom = 1.44×10−10 m
v = speed of the alpha particle = 1.53×107 m/s
m = mass of the alpha particle = 6.64×10−27 kg
k = Coulomb constant = 8.987×109 N·m2/C2
Maximum deflection[edit]
The scattering equation presented earlier in this article is a simplistic description that is only accurate for the small scattering angles that the Thomson model predicts. The following is a general mathematical description that can accurately calculate the scattering angles when the deflection is much stronger, like when an alpha particle comes close to an atomic nucleus. 
Consider an alpha particle passing by the nucleus of a gold atom.[35]

R is the distance between the alpha particle and the nucleus. The nucleus is so small (about 7×10−15 m) that it can be treated as a point. The impact parameter b is the distance between the alpha particle's initial trajectory and a parallel line that goes through the nucleus. The goal here is to find the relationship between b and the deflection angle θ.
The alpha particle's path is a hyperbola and the net change in momentum

{\displaystyle {\vec {\Delta P}}}

 runs along the axis of symmetry. Momentum changes in any other direction (horizontal, vertical, etc.) are canceled out because the path is symmetrical. We can find the magnitude of

The integral above has three unknown variables: t, φ, and R. It needs to be resolved to just one. It so happens that the law of conservation of angular momentum can be used to this end. The alpha particle's angular momentum L is conserved as it is deflected, i.e.

The radius of a gold atom is 1.44×10−10 m. If we use that as the impact parameter b, then the deflection angle θ will be 0.000325 radians (0.0186 degrees). The radius of a gold nucleus is 7×10−15 m, and when we use that value for b, the deflection angle becomes 2.56 radians (147 degrees).

Stopping distance on direct collision[edit]
In Rutherford's 1911 paper The Scattering of α and β Particles by Matter and the Structure of the Atom,[36] Rutherford present the following equation (translated into this article's own notation) that shows the point xmin at which an alpha particle comes to rest when on a direct collision course with an atomic nucleus:

Consider an alpha particle passing straight through a Rutherford gold atom of radius r on a direct collision course with the nucleus, its kinetic energy being 1/2mv2 and its charge qa.

The blue sphere represents the diffuse negative electrification, the electron cloud; the particles and

{\displaystyle x_{\text{min}}}

 are greatly exaggerated in size. Following Rutherford in his 1911 paper, the nucleus is treated as an infinite mass. The negative sphere is also treated as having infinite mass. As the alpha particle approaches the atom, the electron cloud attracts it and the nucleus repels it. When the alpha particle penetrates the electron sphere, the electrons continue to attract it towards the center but to a weaker effect, whereas the nucleus keeps repelling it to the same effect. The nucleus is so small it could be treated as a point.
Let x be the distance between the alpha particle and the center of the atom and xmin be the distance at which the alpha particle come to rest. The amount of work that the electrons exert on the alpha particle will at most be

^ J. J. Thomson, in a letter to Oliver Lodge dated 11 April 1904, quoted in Davis & Falconer (1997):
"With regard to positive electrification I have been in the habit of using the crude analogy of a liquid with a certain amount of cohesion, enough to keep it from flying to bits under its own repulsion. I have however always tried to keep the physical conception of the positive electricity in the background because I have always had hopes (not yet realised) of being able to do without positive electrification as a separate entity and to replace it by some property of the corpuscles.
When one considers that, all the positive electricity does, on the corpuscular theory, is to provide an attractive force to keep the corpuscles together, while all the observable properties of the atom are determined by the corpuscles one feels, I think, that the positive electrification will ultimately prove superfluous and it will be possible to get the effects we now attribute to it from some property of the corpuscle.
At present I am not able to do this and I use the analogy of the liquid as a way of picturing the missing forces which is easily conceived and lends itself readily to analysis."
