Exploring Linear Algebra: Labs and Projects with MATLAB is meant to be a hands-on lab manual that can be used in class every day to guide the exploration of the theory and applications of linear algebra. Most of the labs can be used individually or in a sequence. Each lab consists of an explanation of material with integrated exercises. Some labs are split into multiple subsections and so exercises are separated by those subsections.The exercise sections integrate problems with MATLAB; this allows students to discover the theory and applications of linear algebra in a meaningful and memorable way.
Companion MATLAB code is also available on the MATLAB Central File Exchange.
