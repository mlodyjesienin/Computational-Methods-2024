Introduction

Chapter Objectives

By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:

• Understand and use the terminology of probability.
• Determine whether two events are mutually exclusive and whether two events are independent.
• Calculate probabilities using the Addition Rules and Multiplication Rules.
• Construct and interpret Contingency Tables.
• Construct and interpret Venn Diagrams.
• Construct and interpret Tree Diagrams.

It is often necessary to "guess" about the outcome of an event in order to make a decision. Politicians study polls to guess
their likelihood of winning an election. Teachers choose a particular course of study based on what they think students can
comprehend. Doctors choose the treatments needed for various diseases based on their assessment of likely results. You
may have visited a casino where people play games chosen because of the belief that the likelihood of winning is good. You
may have chosen your course of study based on the probable availability of jobs.

You have, more than likely, used probability. In fact, you probably have an intuitive sense of probability. Probability deals
with the chance of an event occurring. Whenever you weigh the odds of whether or not to do your homework or to study
for an exam, you are using probability. In this chapter, you will learn how to solve probability problems using a systematic
approach.

Your instructor will survey your class. Count the number of students in the class today.

• Raise your hand if you have any change in your pocket or purse. Record the number of raised hands.

CHAPTER 3 | PROBABILITY TOPICS 163



• Raise your hand if you rode a bus within the past month. Record the number of raised hands.

• Raise your hand if you answered "yes" to BOTH of the first two questions. Record the number of raised hands.

Use the class data as estimates of the following probabilities. P(change) means the probability that a randomly chosen
person in your class has change in his/her pocket or purse. P(bus) means the probability that a randomly chosen person
in your class rode a bus within the last month and so on. Discuss your answers.

• Find P(change).

• Find P(bus).

• Find P(change AND bus). Find the probability that a randomly chosen student in your class has change in his/her
pocket or purse and rode a bus within the last month.

• Find P(change|bus). Find the probability that a randomly chosen student has change given that he or she rode a
bus within the last month. Count all the students that rode a bus. From the group of students who rode a bus,
count those who have change. The probability is equal to those who have change and rode a bus divided by those
who rode a bus.

Dear Dr. Kornbluth and Mr. Gorenberg,
The US House of Representatives is deeply concerned by ongoing and pervasive acts of antisemitic 
harassment and intimidation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Failing to act decisively to ensure a safe learning environment for all students would be a grave dereliction of your responsibilities as President of MIT and Chair of the MIT Corporation. 
This Congress will not stand idly by and allow an environment hostile to Jewish students to persist. The House believes that your institution is in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and the inability or 
unwillingness to rectify this violation through action requires accountability.
Postsecondary education is a unique opportunity for students to learn and have their ideas and beliefs challenged. However, universities receiving hundreds of millions of federal funds annually have denied 
students that opportunity and have been hijacked to become venues for the promotion of terrorism, antisemitic harassment and intimidation, unlawful encampments, and in some cases, assaults and riots. 
The House of Representatives will not countenance the use of federal funds to indoctrinate students into hateful, antisemitic, anti-American supporters of terrorism. Investigations into campus antisemitism by the Committee on Education and the Workforce and the Committee on Ways and Means have been expanded into a Congress-wide probe across all relevant jurisdictions to address this national crisis. The undersigned Committees will conduct oversight into the use of federal funds at MIT and its learning environment under authorities granted to each Committee.
• The Committee on Education and the Workforce has been investigating your institution since December 7, 2023. The Committee has broad jurisdiction over postsecondary education, including its compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, campus safety concerns over disruptions to the learning environment, and the awarding of federal student aid under the Higher Education Act.
• The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is investigating the sources of funding and other support flowing to groups espousing pro-Hamas propaganda and engaged in antisemitic harassment and intimidation of students. The Committee on Oversight and Accountability is the principal oversight committee of the US House of Representatives and has broad authority to investigate “any matter” at “any time” under House Rule X.
• The Committee on Ways and Means has been investigating several universities since November 15, 2023, when the Committee held a hearing entitled From Ivory Towers to Dark Corners: Investigating the Nexus Between Antisemitism, Tax-Exempt Universities, and Terror Financing. The Committee followed the hearing with letters to those institutions on January 10, 202বাংলাদেশ অর্থনৈতিক সমীক্ষা (Economic Review) ২০২৪ UJS App.pdfবাংলাদেশ অর্থনৈতিক সমীক্ষা (Economic Review) ২০২৪ UJS App.pdfeBook.com.bd (প্রয়োজনীয় বাংলা বই) বাংলাদেশের অর্থনৈতিক সমীক্ষা ২০২৪ [Bangladesh Economic Review 2024 Bangla.pdf] কম্পিউটার , ট্যাব ও স্মার্ট ফোন ভার্সন সহ সম্পূর্ণ বাংলা ই-বুক বা pdf বই " সুচিপত্র ...বুকমার্ক মেনু 🔖 ও হাইপার লিংক মেনু 📝👆 যুক্ত ..

PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS I...MATATAG CURRICULUM: ASSESSING THE READINESS OF ELEM. PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS I... Lesson 2.3 Mathematical Reasoning and Logic1. 2. Learning Outcomes:
At the  end of this lesson, the students will be able to:
1. Analyze problems using different types of reasoning.
2. Apply different types of reasoning to justify
statements and arguments made about mathematics
and mathematical concepts.
 3. 4. INDUCTIVE REASONING
It is  the process of reaching a
general conclusion by
examining specific examples.
 5. INDUCTIVE REASONING
The conclusion  formed by using
inductive reasoning is often
called a conjecture, since it may
or may not be correct.
 6. Example 1:
Use inductive  reasoning to predict the next number in
each item.
1. 2,8,14,20,26, _____
2. 1,2,5,10,17,26, _____
 7. Example 2:
A. Every  sports car I have ever seen is red. Thus, all
sports cars are red.
B. The coin I pulled from the bag is a 5-peso coin.
Another 5-peso coin is drawn from the bag. A third
coin from the bag is again a 5-peso coin. Therefore,
all the coins in the bag are 5-peso coins.
 8. Example 3:
Consider the  following. Pick a number. Multiply the
number by 4, add 8 to the product, divide the sum by 2,
and subtract 5. Complete the above procedure for
several different numbers. Use inductive reasoning to
make a conjecture about the relationship between the
size of the resulting number and the size of the original
number.
 9. Solution:
Suppose we start  with seven as the original number. Then
repeat the process for different numbers. The procedure yields
the following:
We conjecture that the given procedure produces a number
that is one less than twice the original number.
 10. Remarks:
When we use  inductive reasoning, we have no
guarantee that our conclusion is correct. Just because
a pattern is true for a few cases, it does not mean the
pattern will continue. A statement is a true statement
provided that it is valid in all cases. If we can find one
case for which a statement is not valid, called a
counterexample, then it is a false statement.
 11. DEDUCTIVE REASONING
It is  the process of reaching a
conclusion by applying
general assumptions, procedures,
or principles.
 12. DEDUCTIVE REASONING
Deduction starts  out with a general
statement, or hypothesis, and
examines the possibilities to reach a
specific, logical conclusion.
 13. Example 1:
1. All  men are mortal. Kahwi is a man. Therefore,
Kahwi is mortal.
2. Corresponding parts of congruent triangles are
congruent. Triangle ABC is congruent to triangle
DEF. Angle B and angle E are corresponding angles.
Thus, angle B is congruent to angle E.

  15. Determine if each  of the following statement
uses inductive or deductive reasoning.
1. Teacher Erica is an enthusiastic and passionate teacher.
Therefore, all teachers are enthusiastic and passionate.
2. All dogs are animals. Dhai is a dog. Thus, Dhai is an
animal.
3. I got low score on the first long exam. I just recently took
the second long exam and I got low score. Therefore, I will
also get a low score on the third long exam.

 16. Determine if each  of the following statement
uses inductive or deductive reasoning.
4. My classmates are disrespectful toward our instructor.
Hence, all students are disrespectful.
5. Last Wednesday it was raining. Today is Wednesday and it
is raining. Therefore, on the next Wednesday, it will also rain.
6. For any right triangle, the Pythagorean Theorem holds.
ABC is a right triangle, therefore for ABC the Pythagorean
Theorem holds.
7. All basketball players in your school are tall, so all
basketball players must be tall.

 17. A logic puzzle  is a puzzle deriving from the
mathematics field of deduction.
Logic puzzles can be solved by using deductive
reasoning and by organizing the data in a
given situation.
 18. A logic puzzle  is basically a description of an
event or any situation. Using the clues
provided, one has to piece together what
actually happened. This involves clear and
logical thinking, hence the term “logic” puzzles.
 19. Example 1
Three musicians  appeared at a concert. Their last names were Benton, Lanier, and
Rosario. Each plays only one of the following instruments: guitar, piano, or saxophone.
1. Benton and the guitar player arrived at the concert together.
2. The saxophone player performed before Benton.
3. Rosario wished the guitar player good luck.
Who played each instrument?
Guitar Piano Saxophone
Benton
Lanier
Rosario
 20. Example 2
You have  a basket containing ten apples. You have 10 friends,
who each desire an apple. You give each of your friends, one
apple. Now all your friends have one apple each, yet there is an
apple remaining in the basket. How?
Solution:
✎You give an apple to your first nine friends, and a basket with an apple
to your tenth friend. Each friend has an apple, and one of them has it
in a basket.
✎ Alternative answer: one friend already had an apple and put it in the
basket.
 21. Example 3
A census-taker  knocks on a door, and asks the woman inside
how many children she has and how old they are. “I have three
daughters, their ages are whole numbers, and the product of
their ages is 36,” says the mother. “That’s not enough
information”, responds the census-taker. “I’d tell you the sum of
their ages, but you’d still be stumped.” “I wish you’d tell me
something more.” “Okay, my oldest daughter Annie likes dogs.”
What are the ages of the three daughters (Zeitz, 2007)?
 22. Solution:
After the first  reading, it seems impossible- there isn’t enough information to
determine the ages. The product of the ages is 36, so there are only a few possible
triples of ages. Here is a table of all the possibilities
Age 1, 1,36 1, 2,18 1, 3, 12 1, 4, 9 1, 6, 6 2, 2, 9 2, 3, 6 3, 3, 4
Sum 38 21 16 14 13 13 11 10
Now we see what is going on. The mother’s second statement (“I’d tell you the
sum of their ages, but you’d still be stumped.) gives valuable information. It tells
that the ages are either 1,6,6 or 2,2,9, for in all other cases, knowledge of the sum
would tell unambiguously what the ages are. The final clue now makes sense, it
tells that there is an oldest daughter, eliminating 1, 6,6. The daughters are thus 2,
2, and 9 years old.
 Editor's NotesReasoning is a process based on experience and principles that allow one to arrive at a conclusion.Reasoning is a process based on experience and principles that allow one to arrive at a conclusion.We make generalizations from the part to the whole. If we are not careful, it can lead to erroneous or mistake conclusions:Conjecture- estimation or guessEach successive number is 6 larger than the preceding number.It is not enough that the deduction is logically sound; the assumption (1) must also be true. Consider the following: "1) All cats are red. 2) Kitty is a cat, therefore Kitty is red." It is logically valid but leads to a non-valid conclusion because not 'all cats are red'.In mathematics, deductive reasoning makes use of definitions, axioms, theorems and rules and inference.Download nowAboutSupportTermsPrivacyCopyrightCookie PreferencesDo not sell or share my personal informationEverandEnglishCurrent LanguageEnglishEspañolPortuguesFrançaisDeutsche© 2024 SlideShare from Scribd
