The Early Egyptians



6000 BCE

The Early Egyptians Settled Along The Fertile Nile Valley As Early As About 6000 BCE And They Began To Record The Patterns Of Lunar Phases And The Seasons Both For Agricultural And Religious Reasons https://i.pinimg.com/736x/ae/fe/ae/aefeaee71800d65423f1802dbdd04766--egyptian-art-egyptian-style.jpg

Written Egyptian Numbers



2700 BCE


% complete








It is thought that the Egyptians introduced the earliest fully-developed base 10 numeration system at least as early as 2700 BCE (and probably much early). Written numbers used a stroke for units, a heel-bone symbol for tens, a coil of rope for hundreds and a lotus plant for thousands, as well as other hieroglyphic symbols for higher powers of ten up to a million.http://www.ducksters.com/history/ancient_egypt/hieroglyphic_numbers.gif

Many of the mathematical tablets are "problem texts:" they contain problems or sets of problems, sometimes with solutions. Many of the problems involve geometry; the rest are almost always "word problems" where the context is the calculation of the area of an irregular field, the volume of a ditch, the number of bricks to build a ramp,and etc

Early Chinese Mathematics



1600 BC


% complete








Simple mathematics on Oracle bone script date back to the Shang Dynasty (1600–1050 BC). One of the oldest surviving mathematical works is the Yi Jing, which greatly influenced written literature during the Zhou Dynasty (1050–256 BC). For mathematics, the book included a sophisticated use of hexagrams. Leibniz pointed out, the I Ching contained elements of binary numbers.http://www.storyofmathematics.com/images2/chinese_numerals.gif

Mantras from the early Vedic period (before 1000 BCE) invoke powers of ten from a hundred all the way up to a trillion, and provide evidence of the use of arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, fractions, squares, cubes and roots.http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tkzykF3REkE/VBWuv3VC5xI/AAAAAAAAAUc/WQ8eDrTrwEE/s1600/A%2BHistory%2Bof%2BIndian%2BMathematics_0001.jpg

(GREEK) Classical Mathematics



624 bc - 548 bc


% complete








Historians traditionally place the beginning of Greek mathematics proper to the age of Thales of Miletus (ca. 624–548 BC). Little is known about the life and work of Thales, so little indeed that his date of birth and death are estimated from the eclipse of 585 BC, which probably occurred while he was in his prime. Despite this, it is generally agreed that Thales is the first of the seven wise men of Greece. The two earliest mathematical theorems, Thales' theorem and Intercept theorem are attributed to Thales.

(GREEK) Classical Mathematics



548 bce


% complete








Thales is also thought to be the earliest known man in history to whom specific mathematical discoveries have been attributed. Although it is not known whether or not Thales was the one who introduced into mathematics the logical structure that is so ubiquitous today, it is known that within two hundred years of Thales the Greeks had introduced logical structure and the idea of proof into mathematics.

Babylonian Mathematics

Babylonian mathematics (also known as Assyro-Babylonian mathematics) was any mathematics developed or practiced by the people of Mesopotamia, from the days of the early Sumerians to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited.http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/image/plimpton322.jpeg

by the hellenistic period, theb greeks had presided over one of the most dramatic and important revolutions in mathematical thought of time . the ancient greek numeral system , known as attic or herodianic numerals, was fully developed by about 450 bce , and in regular use possibly as early as the 7th century bce

Father Of Mathematics



There is no one "father" of math, by any reasonable definition. Every mathematician is a father or mother of math. Some are parents to huge swaths of math (e.g. Archimedes, Gauss, Euler, Erdos etc). Others to a single theorem or to a generation of mathematicians.
