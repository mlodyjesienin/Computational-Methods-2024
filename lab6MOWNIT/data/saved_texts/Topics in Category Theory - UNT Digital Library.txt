Description



The purpose of this paper is to examine some basic topics in category theory. A category consists of a class of mathematical objects along with a morphism class having an associative composition. The paper is divided into two chapters. Chapter I deals with intrinsic properties of categories. Various "sub-objects" and properties of morphisms are defined and examples are given. Chapter II deals with morphisms between categories called functors and the natural transformations between functors. Special types of functors are defined and examples are given.
