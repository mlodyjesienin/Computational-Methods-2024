Properties of the determinant
by Marco Taboga, PhD

   In this lecture we derive several useful properties of the
    determinant.


   In order to fully understand this lecture you need to remember the main
   results derived in the lecture on the
    determinant of an
   elementary matrix.

Determinant of a triangular matrix

   The first result concerns the determinant of a
    triangular matrix.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a
      
      triangular matrix (either upper or lower). Then, the determinant of
      
      is equal to the product of its diagonal
      entries:


Proof

Suppose that
   
   is lower triangular. Denote by
   
   the set of all  permutations of
   the first
   
   natural numbers. Let
   
   be the permutation in which the
   
   numbers are sorted in increasing order. The parity of
   
   is even and its sign is
   because
   it does not contain any inversion (see the lecture on the
    sign of a permutation).
   Then, the determinant of
   
   iswhere
   in step
   
   we have used the fact that for all permutations
   
   except
   
   the
   productinvolves
   at least one entry above the main diagonal that is equal to zero. The latter
   fact can be proved by contradiction. Suppose the product involves only
   elements on the main diagonal or below it, and at least one element below it
   (otherwise
   ).
   Then,for
   all
   ,
   but the inequality must be strict for at least one
   .
   Suppose that the inequality is strict for
   .
   Then, we have
   for
   .
   In other words, the permutation
   
   must contain
   
   different natural numbers smaller than or equal to
   ,
   which is clearly impossible. This ends the proof by contradiction. Thus, we
   have proved the proposition for lower triangular matrices. The proof for upper
   triangular matrices is almost identical (we just need to reverse the
   inequalities in the last step).



   A corollary of the proposition above follows.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be an  identity matrix.
      Then,


Proof

The identity matrix is diagonal. Therefore,
   it is triangular and its determinant is equal to the product of its diagonal
   entries. The latter are all equal to
   .
   As a consequence, the determinant of
   
   is equal to
   .


Transposition does not change the determinant

   The next proposition states an elementary but important property of the
   determinant.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a square matrix and denote its transpose by
      .
      Then,


Proof

Denote by
   
   the set of all permutations of the first
   
   natural numbers. For any permutation
   ,
   there is an inverse permutation
   
   such
   thatfor
   .
   If
   
   is obtained by performing a sequence of
    transpositions, then
   
   is obtained by performing the opposite transpositions in reverse order. Thus,
   the number of transpositions is the same and, as a consequence, we have that
   By
   using the concept of inverse permutation, the determinant of
   
   can be easily calculated as
   follows:where:
   in step
   
   we have used the  definition of
   transpose; in step
   
   we have set
   
   and, as a consequence,
   .


The determinant of a matrix with a zero row or column
is zero

   The following property, while pretty intuitive, is often used to prove other
   properties of the determinant.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a square matrix. If
      
      has a zero row (i.e., a row whose entries are all equal to zero) or a zero
      column,
      then


Proof

This property can be proved by using the
   definition of
   determinantFor
   every permutation
   ,
   we have
   thatbecause
   the product contains one entry from each row (column), but one of the rows
   (columns) contains only zeros.
   Therefore,


The determinant of a singular matrix is zero

   We are now going to state one of the most important properties of the
   determinant.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a square matrix. Then
      
      is  invertible if and only if
      and
      it is singular if and only if
      


Proof

The matrix
   
   is  row equivalent to a unique
   matrix
   
   in  reduced row echelon
   form (RREF). Since
   
   and
   
   are row equivalent, we have
   thatwhere
   
   are  elementary matrices.
   Moreover, by the
    properties of the
   determinants of elementary matrices, we have
   thatBut
   the determinant of an elementary matrix is different from zero.
   Therefore,where
   
   is a non-zero constant. If
   
   is invertible,
   
   is the identity matrix and
   If
   
   is singular,
   
   has at least one zero row because the only square RREF matrix that has no zero
   rows is the identity matrix, and the latter is row equivalent only to
   non-singular matrices. We have proved above that matrices that have a zero row
   have zero determinant. Thus, if
   
   is singular,
   
   andTo
   sum up, we have proved that all invertible matrices have non-zero determinant,
   and all singular matrices have zero determinant. Since a matrix is either
   invertible or singular, the two logical implications ("if and only if")
   follow.


Determinant of product equals product of determinants

   The next proposition shows that the determinant of a product of two matrices
   is equal to the product of their determinants.


Proposition
      Let
      
      and
      
      be two
      
      matrices.
      Then,


Proof

If one of the two matrices is singular
   (i.e., not full rank), then their product
   
   is singular
   becauseas
   explained in the lecture entitled
    Matrix product and
   rank. Therefore,
   and
   at least one of
   
   or
   
   is zero, so
   thatThus,
   the statement in the proposition is true if at least one of the two matrices
   is singular. If neither of them is singular, then
    we can write them as products of
   elementary
   matrices:where
   
   and
   
   are elementary matrices. Since the determinant of a product of elementary
   matrices is equal to the products of their determinants, we have
   thatThus,
   we have proved that the statement in the proposition is true also in the case
   when the two matrices are non-singular.


Determinant of inverse

   The previous proposition allows us to easily find the determinant of the inverse
   of a matrix.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a
      
      invertible matrix.
      Then,


Proof

Sincewe
   have
   thatBut
   the determinant of a product equals the product of
   determinants:and
   As
   a
   consequence,Furthermore,
   the determinant of an invertible matrix is different from zero, so that we can
   divide both sides of the equation above by
   
   and
   obtain


Effect of multiplying a matrix by a scalar

   This sub-section presents an easy-to-prove proposition about the
    multiplication
   of a matrix by a scalar. Before reading the proof, try to prove it by
   yourself as an exercise.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a
      
      matrix. Then, for any scalar
      ,


Proof

This proposition is easily proved by using
   the definition of
   determinant.


Effect of multiplying a row or column by a scalar

   This property is similar to the previous one.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a
      
      matrix. Let
      
      be a scalar. Let
      
      be a matrix obtained from
      
      by multiplying a row (or column) by
      .
      Then,
      


Proof

Suppose the
   -th
   row has been multiplied by
   .
   By the definition of
   determinant:If
   instead the
   -th
   column is multiplied by
   ,
   the same result holds because transposition does not change the determinant.


Linearity in rows and columns

   The determinant is linear in the rows and columns of the matrix.


Proposition
      Let
      
      be a
      
      matrix. Denote by
      
      the
      -th
      row of
      .
      Supposewhere
      
      and
      
      are two
      
      vectors and
      
      and
      
      are two scalars. Denote by
      
      the matrix obtained from
      
      by substituting
      
      with
      .
      Denote by
      
      the matrix obtained from
      
      by substituting
      
      with
      .
      Then,


Proof

By the definition of determinant, we
   have



Proposition
      Let
      
      be a
      
      matrix. Denote by
      
      the
      -th
      column of
      .
      Supposewhere
      
      and
      
      are two
      
      vectors and
      
      and
      
      are two scalars. Denote by
      
      the matrix obtained from
      
      by substituting
      
      with
      .
      Denote by
      
      the matrix obtained from
      
      by substituting
      
      with
      .
      Then,


Proof

This is a consequence of the previous
   proposition (linearity in columns) and of the fact that transpositions does
   not change the determinant.


The determinant and the LU decomposition

   One of the easiest and more convenient ways to compute the determinant of a
   square matrix
   
   is based on the  LU
   decompositionwhere
   ,
   
   and
   
   are a  permutation matrix, a
   lower triangular and an upper triangular matrix respectively. We can
   writeand
   the determinants of
   ,
   
   and
   
   are easy to compute:





         if the number of row interchanges needed to obtain
         
         from the identity matrix is even; otherwise,
         ;
      




         is equal to the product of the diagonal entries of
         
         because
         
         is lower triangular;
      




         is equal to the product of the diagonal entries of
         
         because
         
         is upper triangular.
