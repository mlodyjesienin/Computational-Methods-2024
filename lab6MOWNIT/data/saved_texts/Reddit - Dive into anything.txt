       Can we apply differential geometry main idea to physics 







    I found very much similiarity. Like manifold is a our World that we cant grasp immediatly we only can observe some part of it. Charts are like observers that take information from our world and informatian is intrepretation or math that we understand very well like Rn. Is there any physical theory that has this idea? And will we get useful things?
