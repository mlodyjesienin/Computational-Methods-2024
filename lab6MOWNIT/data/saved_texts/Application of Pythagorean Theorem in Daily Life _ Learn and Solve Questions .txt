Right-Angled TriangleIn the figure shown above, $ABC$ is a right-angle triangle with right angled at $B$ and $AC$ in the hypotenuse, $BC$ is the base for angle $C$ and $AB$ is perpendicular. $\underline{\underline{\text { So }}}$ in this Triangle according to Pythagoras' Theorem:$(A C)^{2}=(A B)^{2}+(BC)^{2}$In this article, we will be discussing the real-life application of the Pythagoras theorem, i.e., the application of the theorem in our daily life.History of MathematicianThe Pythagorean theorem takes its name from the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras.




Scientist PythagorasName: PythagorasBorn: About 570 BCDied: About 490 BCField: Mathematics and PhilosopherNationality: GreekStatement of Pythagoras TheoremPythagoras theorem states that “In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the perpendicular and the base, i.e., the other sides of the triangle.”




Statement of Pythagoras Theorem In the above triangle, for angle $B, B C$ is the hypotenuse, $A B$ is the base, and $A C$ is the perpendicular. So,$(B C)^{2}=(A B)^{2}+(AC)^{2}$Note: Hypotenuse is the longest side of the right-angle triangle.The Formula of Pythagoras Theorem$(\text { Hypotenuse })^{2}=(\text { Base })^{2}+(\text { Perpendicular })^{2} \\$$(B C)^{2}=(A B)^{2}+(AC)^{2}$where BC is hypotenuse, AB is base, and AC is perpendicular for right-angled triangle ABC.Proof of Pythagoras TheoremGiven: A right-angled triangle $\mathrm{ABC}$, right-angled at $\mathrm{B}$.To Prove: $A C^{2}=A B^{2}+B C^{2}$Construction: Draw a perpendicular BD meeting $A C$ at $D$.




Construction to Prove Pythagoras TheoremWe know $\triangle A D B \sim \triangle A B C$Therefore,$\dfrac{A D}{A B}=\dfrac{A B}{A C}$(Corresponding sides of similar triangles)Or, $A B^{2}=A D \times A C$Also, $\triangle B D C \sim \triangle A B C$Therefore,$\dfrac{C D}{B C}=\dfrac{B C}{A C}$(Corresponding sides of similar triangles)or, $B C^{2}=C D \times A C$Adding the equations (1) and (2), we get,$A B^{2}+B C^{2}=A D \times A C+C D \times A C$$\Rightarrow A B^{2}+B C^{2}=A C(A D+C D)$Since $A D+C D=A C$Therefore, $A C^{2}=A B^{2}+B C^{2}$Hence, we proved Pythagoras theorem.Now, Let us discuss the converse of Pythagoras Theorem with detailed proof.Converse of Pythagoras Theorem and Its Proof




Two Right-Angled Similar Triangles In a triangle, if the square of one side is equal to the sum of the other two sides, then the angle opposite the first side is a right angle.Given: $\ln \Delta X Y Z, X Y^{2}+Y Z^{2}=X Z^{2}$To prove: $\angle X Y Z=90^{\circ}$Construction: A triangle PQR is constructed such that a triangle $P Q R$ is constructed such that$P Q=X Y, Q R=Y Z \angle P Q R=90^{\circ}$Proof: $\ln \triangle P Q R, \angle Q=90^{\circ}$$P R^{2}=P Q^{2}+Q R^{2}$ {Pythagoras theorem}or $P R^{2}=X Y^{2}+Y Z^{2} \ldots$ (i) $[P Q=X Y, Q R=Y Z]$But we know $X Z^{2}=X Y^{2}+Y Z^{2} \ldots \ldots$ (ii) (given)Therefore, $X Z^{2}=P R^{2}$ {From equation (i) and (ii)}or $X Z=P R$or $\triangle X Y Z \cong \triangle P Q R$ {SSS congruence rule}Therefore, $\angle Y=\angle Q=90^{\circ}$ {CPCT}Hence, $\angle X Y Z=90^{\circ}$The converse of Pythagoras theorem is proved.Application of Pythagoras TheoremPythagoras Theorem is used to find the steepness of hills.In Artificial intelligence: face recognition features in security cameras use the Pythagorean theorem. The distance between the camera and the person is recorded.Pythagoras Theorem is used to find the shortest distance in Navigation.The concept of the Pythagoras Theorem is also used in Interior Designing.Pythagoras theorem is used to find the third side of a right-angled triangle when 2 sides are given.In Engineering, the diameter can be easily calculated when length and breadth are known using Pythagoras Theorem.LimitationsPythagoras Theorem is only applicable in the case of the Right-Angled Triangle. If one of the angles is not 90 degrees, then we cannot use Pythagoras Theorem.Pythagoras Theorem is only useful in the case of 2-dimensional figures. It cannot be applied in the case of 3-dimensional figures or objects.Solved Examples1. The perpendicular of a right-angled triangle is given as 12cm and the hypotenuse is given as 13cm. Find the base of the given triangle.Solution:Perpendicular $=12 \mathrm{~cm}$Base $=b \mathrm{~cm}$Hypotenuse $=13 \mathrm{~cm}$As per the Pythagorean Theorem, we have$Perpendicular^{2}+ Base^{2}= Hypotenuse^{2}$$\Rightarrow 12^{2}+b^{2}=13^{2}$ $\Rightarrow 144+b^{2}=169$ $\Rightarrow b^{2}=169-144$ $\Rightarrow b^{2}=25$ $\Rightarrow b=\sqrt{25}$Therefore, $b=5 \mathrm{~cm}$2. The sides of a triangle are 15, 17, and 8 units. Check if it has a right angle or not.Solution:  Clearly, 17 is the longest side.It also satisfies the condition $15+8>17$We know$c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}$So, let $a=15, b=8$, and $c=17$First, we will solve R.H.S. of Equation (1).$a^{2}+b^{2}=15^{2}+8^{2}=225+64=289$Now, taking L.H.S, we get$c^{2}=17^{2}=289$We can see LHS=RHS.Therefore, the given triangle is a right triangle, as it satisfies the Pythagoras theorem.




To Check Angle of TriangleImportant FormulasFor any Right-Angled Triangle,$(\text { Hypotenuse })^{2}=(\text { Base })^{2}+(\text { Perpendicular })^{2}$Important Points to RememberPythagoras theorem is applicable only in case of a right-angled triangle.Trigonometry is based on the Pythagoras Theorem.ConclusionIn this article, we discussed the Pythagoras Theorem in depth. The proof, statement, applications, and examples are thoroughly explained above. From the discussion above about the Pythagoras theorem, we can conclude that it is a very useful theorem to be used in solving questions of a right-angle triangle and it helps us in real life a lot.Popular Vedantu Learning Centres Near YouMithanpura, MuzaffarpurVedantu Learning Centre, 2nd Floor, Ugra Tara Complex, Club Rd, opposite Grand Mall, Mahammadpur Kazi, Mithanpura, Muzaffarpur, Bihar 842002Visit CentreAnna Nagar, ChennaiVedantu Learning Centre, Plot No. Y - 217, Plot No 4617, 2nd Ave, Y Block, Anna Nagar, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600040Visit CentreVelachery, ChennaiVedantu Learning Centre, 3rd Floor, ASV Crown Plaza, No.391, Velachery - Tambaram Main Rd, Velachery, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600042Visit CentreTambaram, ChennaiShree Gugans School CBSE, 54/5, School road, Selaiyur, Tambaram, Chennai, Tamil Nadu 600073Visit CentreAvadi, ChennaiVedantu Learning Centre, Ayyappa Enterprises - No: 308 / A CTH Road Avadi, Chennai - 600054Visit CentreDeeksha Vidyanagar, BangaloreSri Venkateshwara Pre-University College, NH 7, Vidyanagar, Bengaluru International Airport Road, Bengaluru, Karnataka 562157Visit CentreView MoreCompetitive Exams after 12th ScienceRecently Updated PagesFactors of 29 | How to Find the Factors of 29How Can We Round off to the Nearest Tens in Maths?Matchstick Patterns - Learn and Solve QuestionsSieve of Eratosthenes - Method to Find Prime Numbers with Solved ExamplesFactors of 78 | Learn and Solve QuestionsFactors for 225 - Definition, Methods, Solved Examples and FAQsFactors of 29 | How to Find the Factors of 29How Can We Round off to the Nearest Tens in Maths?Matchstick Patterns - Learn and Solve QuestionsSieve of Eratosthenes - Method to Find Prime Numbers with Solved ExamplesFactors of 78 | Learn and Solve QuestionsFactors for 225 - Definition, Methods, Solved Examples and FAQs12Trending topicsTo The Beat of The Clock - The AM and PM1 Billion in Rupees11 to 20 Spelling for Kids - Number Names for KidsXXXVII Roman Numeral - Conversion, Rules, Uses, and FAQsHow to Calculate the Percentage of Marks?Types of AnglesTrillionList of Composite Numbers from 1 to 100Temperature ConversionTo The Beat of The Clock - The AM and PM1 Billion in Rupees11 to 20 Spelling for Kids - Number Names for KidsXXXVII Roman Numeral - Conversion, Rules, Uses, and FAQsHow to Calculate the Percentage of Marks?Types of AnglesTrillionList of Composite Numbers from 1 to 100Temperature Conversion123Other PagesHow to Convert Fractions Into Whole Numbers?Quadratic Equation QuestionsStatistics For Class 10Properties of DeterminantsFunction TransformationBisection MethodHow to Convert Fractions Into Whole Numbers?Quadratic Equation QuestionsStatistics For Class 10Properties of DeterminantsFunction TransformationBisection Method12FAQs on Application of Pythagorean Theorem in Daily Life1. Discuss some important facts about Pythagoras's triples?Some important facts are listed below:Pythagoras' Triplets cannot have decimals. They can only be Natural Numbers.There is only one triple with three consecutive number pairs, i.e., $(3,4,5)$.All triples in Arithmetic Progression are multiples of $(3,4,5)$.The multiples of Pythagoras triple $(5,12,13)$ again gives us a unique Pythagoras Triple.A Pythagorean Triple can never be made of all odd numbers or two even numbers and one odd number.There are 16 groups of Pythagorean triples under $100 .$2. Can the Pythagorean Theorem Formula be applied to any triangle?No, Pythagoras Theorem can only be applied to right-angled triangles. The relation between the sides of a triangle, i.e., the sum of the square of two sides is equal to the square of the third side is satisfied only in a right-angled triangle. For acute and obtuse angled triangles, the sum of squares of two sides of a triangle is smaller and greater than the square of the third side, respectively. So, Pythagoras Theorem can not be applied in that case.3. What are the different ways to prove Pythagoras's theorem?There are different ways to prove Pythagoras' Theorem. There are 371 proofs of Pythagoras Theorem. Some of them are discussed below:We can prove it using the properties of similar triangles.Euclid’s proof can also be used to prove the Pythagorean Theorem.We can also prove it using Differential Equations. With the help of Algebraic Proofs Pythagorean Theorem can also be proved.Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement can also be used to prove the theorem and so on.4. How did the Pythagorean theorem change the world? The Pythagoras theorem has changed the world with its massive applications in Mathematics, Science, and technology. For the past 2500-2500 years, the Pythagoras theorem, arguably the utmost well-known theorem worldwide, has significantly been useful to mankind. Its beneficial right angles are ubiquitous, whether it is a building, a graph with axes, or the atomic structure.Study materialNCERTNCERTNCERT SolutionsNCERT Solutions for Class 12NCERT Solutions for Class 12 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 PhysicsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 ChemistryNCERT Solutions for Class 12 BiologyNCERT Solutions for Class 12 Business StudiesNCERT Solutions for Class 12 EconomicsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 AccountancyNCERT Solutions for Class 12 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 12 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 11NCERT Solutions for Class 11 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 PhysicsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 ChemistryNCERT Solutions for Class 11 BiologyNCERT Solutions for Class 11 Business StudiesNCERT Solutions for Class 11 EconomicsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 AccountancyNCERT Solutions for Class 11 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 11 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 10NCERT Solutions for Class 10 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 10 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 10 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 10 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 10 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 9NCERT Solutions for Class 9 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 9 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 9 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 9 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 9 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 8NCERT Solutions for Class 8 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 8 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 8 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 8 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 8 HindiNCERT BooksNCERT Books Class 12NCERT Books Class 11NCERT Books Class 10NCERT Books Class 9NCERT Books Class 8Reference book solutionsReference Book SolutionsHC Verma SolutionsRD Sharma SolutionsRS Aggarwal SolutionsNCERT Exemplar SolutionsLakhmir Singh SolutionsDK Goel SolutionsTS Grewal  SolutionsSandeep GargCompetitive ExamsCompetitive ExamsJEE MainJEE AdvancedNEETOlympiad PreparationNDAKVPYNTSECBSECBSECBSE SyllabusCBSE Sample PaperCBSE WorksheetsCBSE Important QuestionsCBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10CBSE Important FormulasICSEICSEICSE SolutionsICSE Class 10 SolutionsICSE Class 9 SolutionsICSE Class 8 Solutions State boardsState BoardsAP BoardBihar BoardGujarat BoardKarnataka BoardKerala BoardMaharashtra BoardMP BoardRajasthan BoardTelangana BoardTN BoardUP BoardWB BoardFree Study MaterialFree Study MaterialPrevious Year Question PapersSample PapersJEE Main Study MaterialsJEE Advanced Study MaterialsNEET Study MaterialsOlympiad Study MaterialsKids LearningAsk QuestionsImportant SubjectsPhysicsBiologyChemistryMathsEnglishCommerceGeographyCivicsRevision NotesRevision NotesCBSE Class 12 NotesCBSE Class 11 NotesCBSE Class 10 NotesCBSE Class 9 NotesCBSE Class 8 Notes JEE MAINJEE MainJEE Main Important QuestionsJEE Main Important ChaptersJEE Main NotesJEE Main FormulasJEE Main Difference betweenJEE Main SyllabusJEE Main Physics SyllabusJEE Main Mathematics SyllabusJEE Main Chemistry SyllabusJEE Main Previous Year Question PaperJEE ADVANCEDJEE AdvancedJEE Advanced Important QuestionsJEE Advanced Important ChaptersJEE Advanced NotesJEE Advanced FormulasJEE Advanced Difference betweenJEE Advanced SyllabusJEE Advanced Physics SyllabusJEE Advanced Mathematics SyllabusJEE Advanced Chemistry SyllabusJEE Advanced Previous Year Question Paper NEETNEETNEET Important QuestionsNEET Important ChaptersNEET NotesNEET DiagramsNEET Difference betweenNEET SyllabusNEET Physics SyllabusNEET Chemistry SyllabusNEET Biology SyllabusNEET Previous Year Question Paper OFFLINE CENTRESMuzaffarpurChennaiBangalorePatialaDelhiHyderabadVijayawadaVisakhapatnamTiruchirapalliMadurai CoimbatorePuneNagpurGunturAurangabadRaipurBhilaiBilaspurSrinagarJammuBhubaneswarJhunjhunu © 2024.Vedantu.com.
