Proceedings of Symposia in Pure Mathematics






                                        Volume: 83; 2011; 354 pp




                                            MSC: Primary 81; 70; 18; 55


Conceptual progress in fundamental theoretical physics is linked with the search for the suitable mathematical structures that model the physical systems. Quantum field theory (QFT) has proven to be a rich source of ideas for mathematics for a long time. However, fundamental questions such as “What is a QFT?” did not have satisfactory mathematical answers, especially on spaces with arbitrary topology, fundamental for the formulation of perturbative string theory.This book contains a collection of papers highlighting the mathematical foundations of QFT and its relevance to perturbative string theory as well as the deep techniques that have been emerging in the last few years.The papers are organized under three main chapters: Foundations for Quantum Field Theory, Quantization of Field Theories, and Two-Dimensional Quantum Field Theories. An introduction, written by the editors, provides an overview of the main underlying themes that bind together the papers in the volume.
Readership
Graduate students and research mathematicians interested in mathematical aspects of quantum field theory.
