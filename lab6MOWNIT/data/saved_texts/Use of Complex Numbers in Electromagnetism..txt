I read in an article that the theory of Electromagnetism makes use of Complex Numbers. How are the tools and tricks of Complex Numbers used in Electromagnetic theory. I just wanted to understand the basics of this connection of Complex Numbers and Electromagnetism and figure out if this technique could help me to solve problems more efficiently.

Thanks.

Maybe they talked about Möbius transformations ? Do you know the name of the "technique" ? And also there is lot of different problems i EM-theory, are there any perticular problems you want to solve?

In Electromagnetism you often deal with sinusoidal waveforms. The link between sinusoidals and complex numbers is done by Euler's[/PLAIN] formula. In this way you can write the sinusoidals as complex exponentials, a technique which simplifies very much the calculations.
For example differentiating with respect to [tex]t[/tex] (the time) becomes equivalent with multiplying by [tex]j\omega[/tex], integrating becomes equivalent with dividing by [tex]j\omega[/tex], and the multiplication/division operations become more handy.

No particular problems. 'i EM-theory', as you call it, is a fairly new stuff for me. I just wanted to know its basics. It would be great if you could find me a reference to it. 

And by the way, what's Möbius transformations?

Never heard of "i EM theory", just as antonantal said, rewriting cos and sinus as complex numbers via Eulers formulas, you gain a lot.

 'i EM-theory' was supposed to read 'in EM theory'.

That's a typo... "*in* EM-theory". If you want to learn about complex numbers in EM, just learn about complex numbers in waves.

I thought that 'i' stand for iota for complex numbers. 

Anyway, Möbius transformation is way above my head.

"complex numbers in waves", that's a good connection. Thanks genneth.

Möbuis transformation you use to solve laplace equation in an easier way, and that equation comes up in certain field theories =)

 





















Related to Use of Complex Numbers in Electromagnetism.

What are complex numbers?Complex numbers are numbers that have both a real part and an imaginary part. They are written in the form a + bi, where "a" is the real part and "bi" is the imaginary part multiplied by the imaginary unit i.How are complex numbers used in electromagnetism?Complex numbers are used in electromagnetism to represent the amplitude and phase of electric and magnetic fields. They are also used to describe the impedance of circuits, which is necessary for understanding how electricity flows through a system.Can electromagnetism equations be solved without using complex numbers?Yes, some equations in electromagnetism can be solved without using complex numbers by breaking them down into real and imaginary components. However, using complex numbers makes the calculations and solutions more concise and efficient.What advantages do complex numbers offer in electromagnetism?Complex numbers offer several advantages in electromagnetism. They allow for a more concise representation of electric and magnetic fields, they make calculations and solutions more efficient, and they provide a deeper understanding of the behavior of electricity in circuits.Are there any real-life applications of complex numbers in electromagnetism?Yes, there are many real-life applications of complex numbers in electromagnetism. Some examples include designing electronic circuits, analyzing the behavior of electromagnetic waves, and modeling the behavior of antennas and other devices that use electromagnetic fields.
