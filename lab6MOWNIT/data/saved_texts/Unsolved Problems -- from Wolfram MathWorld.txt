Unsolved Problems






There are many unsolved problems in mathematics. Some prominent outstanding unsolved problems (as well as some which are not necessarily
 so well known) include 


1. The Goldbach conjecture. 


2. The Riemann hypothesis. 


3. The conjecture that there exists a Hadamard matrix
for every positive multiple of 4. 


4. The twin prime conjecture (i.e., the conjecture that there are an infinite number of twin primes).
 


5. Determination of whether NP-problems are actually
P-problems. 


6. The Collatz problem. 


7. Proof that the 196-algorithm does not terminate
when applied to the number 196. 


8. Proof that 10 is a solitary number. 


9. Finding a formula for the probability that two elements chosen at random generate the symmetric group . 


10. Solving the happy end problem for arbitrary . 


11. Finding an Euler brick whose space diagonal is
also an integer. 


12. Proving which numbers can be represented as a sum of three or four (positive
or negative) cubic numbers. 


13. Lehmer's Mahler measure problem and Lehmer's totient problem on the existence
 of composite numbers  such that , where  is the totient function.
 


14. Determining if the Euler-Mascheroni
constant is irrational. 


15. Deriving an analytic form for the square site percolation
threshold. 


16. Determining if any odd perfect numbers exist.


The Clay Mathematics Institute (http://www.claymath.org/millennium/) of Cambridge, Massachusetts (CMI) has named seven "Millennium Prize Problems,"
 selected by focusing on important classic questions in mathematics that have resisted
 solution over the years. A $7 million prize fund has been established for the solution
 to these problems, with $1 million allocated to each. The problems consist of the
 Riemann hypothesis, Poincaré
 conjecture, Hodge conjecture, Swinnerton-Dyer
 Conjecture, solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, formulation of Yang-Mills
 theory, and determination of whether NP-problems are
 actually P-problems.


In 1900, David Hilbert proposed a list of 23 outstanding problems in mathematics (Hilbert's problems), a number of which have
 now been solved, but some of which remain open. In 1912, Landau proposed four simply
 stated problems, now known as Landau's problems,
 which continue to defy attack even today. One hundred years after Hilbert, Smale
 (2000) proposed a list of 18 outstanding problems.


K. S. Brown, D. Eppstein, S. Finch, and C. Kimberling maintain webpages of unsolved problems in mathematics. Classic texts on unsolved problems
 in various areas of mathematics are Croft et al. (1991), in geometry,
 and Guy (2004), in number theory.
