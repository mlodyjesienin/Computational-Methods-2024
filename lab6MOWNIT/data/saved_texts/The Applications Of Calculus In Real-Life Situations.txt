The Applications Of Calculus In Real-Life Situations
19 Apr 2023

Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and the accumulation of infinitesimal quantities. Everything from deferential calculus to integral calculus can be traced backed to its development in the late 17th century by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and has been an essential tool in advancing science and technology ever since.
Although it can be a challenging subject to master, calculus is a fundamental tool that has practical applications in various fields, from engineering to economics and even in everyday life. In this article, we will discuss some of the most common applications of calculus in real-life situations.
1. Optimisation
Optimisation is the process of finding the maximum or minimum value of a function. Calculus optimises the performance of machines, businesses, and even the human body. For example, a manufacturer may use calculus to enhance the production process in order to minimise costs and maximise profits. Similarly, a fitness trainer may use calculus to design an exercise routine that maximises the benefits while minimising the risk of injury.
2. Physics
Calculus is used extensively in physics to study system behaviour and make predictions about them. For instance, calculus is vital to calculate the trajectory of a projectile, the speed of a moving object, and the rate of change of acceleration. In addition, calculus is needed to study the behaviour of complex systems, such as the planets’ motion or fluids’ behaviour.
3. Engineering
Calculus is a fundamental tool in engineering, as it is used to design and optimise complex systems. It is an integral aspect of designing bridges and buildings, optimising the performance of engines and machines, and developing new technologies.
4. Economics
The study of the behaviour of markets and making predictions about future trends is a delicate task that requires extensive use of calculus. For example, calculating the elasticity of demand, the rate of change of prices, and the optimal level of production for a company requires calculus.
5. Medicine
Calculus is used in medicine to model biological systems’ behaviour and develop new treatments. It can also be used to study cancer cell patterns, design drug dosages, and study the spread of infectious diseases.
6. Finance
We also model the financial market and develop new investment strategies via calculus. The field of study can be utilised to calculate the present value of future cash flows, model the behaviour of stock prices, and develop new risk management techniques.
7. Computer Science
Calculus is employed in computer science to optimise algorithms and analyse computer systems behaviour. For example, calculus is used to optimise computer network performance, analyse complex software systems’ behaviour, and develop new machine learning algorithms.
8. Architecture
Calculus is applied in architecture to design buildings with complex shapes and curves. Designing the curves of a bridge, optimising the shape of a building for maximum sunlight exposure or designing the curves of a rollercoaster are just some examples of the way it is used in architecture.
Conclusion
Calculus is a powerful tool that is used in a wide range of real-life situations. Its applications can be found in many fields, from engineering to physics, economics, medicine, and beyond. As technology advances, the importance of calculus will only continue to grow, and it will remain a vital tool for solving complex problems and optimising systems.
