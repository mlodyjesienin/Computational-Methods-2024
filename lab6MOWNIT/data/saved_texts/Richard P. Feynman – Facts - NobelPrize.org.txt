Richard P. Feynman
The Nobel Prize in Physics 1965 
Born: 11 May 1918, New York, NY, USA 
Died: 15 February 1988, Los Angeles, CA, USA 

Affiliation at the time of the award:
California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Pasadena, CA, USA 

Prize motivation: “for their fundamental work in quantum electrodynamics, with deep-ploughing consequences for the physics of elementary particles” 

Prize share: 1/3 



Work 

Following the establishment of the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, an initial relativistic theory was formulated for the interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic fields. This needed to be reformulated, however. In 1948 in particular, Richard Feynman contributed to creating a new quantum electrodynamics by introducing Feynman diagrams: graphic representations of various interactions between different particles. These diagrams facilitate the calculation of interaction probabilities.
