Established in 2015, MAPR comprises three distinct sites in Washington, Tennessee, and New Mexico. These sites led the effort to build a bomb to end World War II. Each one made incredible advances to the science, manufacturing, and engineering that ushered the globe into the âatomic age.âHere in Los Alamos, New Mexico, about 30 landmarks are officially part of MAPR. Many of these places, like J. Robert Oppenheimerâs house, Ashley Pond, and Fuller Lodge, are publicly accessible.

Other landmarks are âbehind the fenceâ at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Because of their locations, these landmarks are only accessible to small groups a few times per year.

To celebrate 80 years of scientific achievement and to commemorate the Manhattan Project, MAPR is hosting a series of trivia contests and other sweepstakes throughout the year.Follow us on Facebook to participateOur goals
At MAPR, we strive to:
Preserve and protect, for the benefit of present and future generations, the nationally significant historic resources associated with the Manhattan Project.

Before and after of S-site, where high explosives were stored during the Manhattan Project.

Improve public understanding of the Manhattan Project and its legacy through interpretation of the historic resources associated with the Manhattan Project.

Visitors learn about the Creutz test, an experiment conducted two days before Gadget was detonated at Trinity site. The Creutz test used a full-scale mock-up of Fat Man without the nuclear material.

Enhance public access to the Park established under the Act consistent with protection of public safety, national security, and other aspects of the DOEâs mission.
