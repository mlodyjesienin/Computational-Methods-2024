Abstract

	The pivotal engineering and scientific success of the Twentieth century was the Manhattan
	Project.  The Manhattan Project assimilated concepts and leaders from all scientific fields
	and engineering disciplines to construct the first two atomic bombs.  From the study of 
	nuclear physics and chemistry to the practical engineering and processing of uranium 235 
	and plutonium 239 and the final construction of the weapons, scientific knowledge grew at 
	an exponential rate to critical levels.  The presence of communication amid scientific minds 
	was equally important to the success of the Manhattan Project as scientific intellect was. 
	The only cloud hanging over the impressive achievement of the atomic researchers and 
	engineers is what their success truly meant; hundreds of thousands of innocent lives 
	obliterated.  Yet this grave definition of success cannot diminish the impressive 
	collaboration and efficiency of the Manhattan Project.

Introduction

	The Manhattan Project was the American program for researching and developing the first 
	atomic bombs.  The weapons produced were based solely upon the principles of nuclear fission
	of uranium 235 and plutonium 239, chain reactions liberating immense amounts of destructive 
	heat energy.  Although originally established in Manhattan, New York by the Manhattan 
	Engineer District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the majority of the research took 
	place under director General Leslie Groves at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico.  The 
	goal of the Manhattan Project was effectively summed up by scientist Robert Serber when he 
	deduced, �Since the one factor that determines the damage is the energy release, our aim is 
	simply to get as much energy from the explosion as we can.�[1] Thus, due to the nature of the
	program�s objective, the Manhattan Project is one of scientific engineering�s foremost 
	successes.
	

	In the quest for an atomic-powered weapon, the secrets of nuclear physics and chemistry were
	exposed.  Following the theoretical assessment of producing a controllable nuclear chain 
	reactor, physical engineering was employed to construct the specific mechanics required.  
	Communication contributed as much to the success of the Manhattan Project as did scientific 
	discovery.  Although the creation of the first atomic weapon was clearly a technological 
	triumph, the question of morality and responsibility to ethics will forever plague the topic.
	Regardless of whether America was morally justified in deploying atomic weaponry on Japan, 
	though, the Manhattan Project will always be an excellent example of collaboration and 
	communication in scientific and engineering fields.   
	
Importance of Core Engineering Disciplines to the Manhattan Project


	�A little bomb like that,� declared physicist Enrico Fermi, enthralled by his first taste of 
	nuclear fission, �and it would all disappear.�[2].  
	

	The Atomic Age, a period of incessant discovery and revelation of atomic and subatomic 
	wonders - an age that revolutionized the physical world - began on a vacant playing field 
	beneath the University of Chicago stadium on December 2, 1942.  In the late afternoon of this
	momentous day, Fermi and Leo Szilard created the first controlled nuclear reactor, a model 
	later reconstructed into five different reactor prototypes.[3] From the first controllable 
	chain reaction to the dropping of atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, the fields
	of physics, chemistry, and mathematics - the core disciplines of modern engineering � raced 
	mercilessly ahead to godly enlightenment: the power of life and annihilation.
	

	The first atomic bomb, a weapon harnessing the devastating power of nuclear fission, was 
	developed as an end to World War II and all war thereafter.  Comprehension of the bomb and 
	its historical development is attained by breaking the subject into three related components:
	chemistry, nuclear physics, and the practical engineering that realized the theoretical dream.
	
The Chemistry Aspect
	
	Fission is an elementary chemical interaction between subatomic particles.  Nuclear fission 
	is defined as the splitting of an atom by nucleus bombardment.  Atoms consist of three 
	subatomic particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutrons, 
	which have no electrical charge.  Atomic nuclei are dense cores of atoms composed of neutrons
	and protons, and are thus positively charged.  Chemical reactions, from basic acid-base 
	titrations to nuclear fission, involve the collision of atomic particles. 
	

	Fission begins with the high-energy collision of neutrons with the nucleus of another atom.  
	Protons cannot partake in nuclear bombardment because of the electrostatic repulsion between 
	positively-charged protons and nuclei.  For fission to proceed, a neutron fired at the atom 
	must fuse with the nucleus, producing a less-stable isotope.  The �heavy� atom, chemically 
	volatile, will split into two stable atoms, discharge neutrons, and generate energy (in the 
	form of Gamma radiation).  The neutrons released are free to collide and fuse with nuclei of
	other nearby atoms � a chain reaction ensues, progressing exponentially throughout the sample of atoms, releasing more and more heat radiation.  It is this constant amplification of energy that constitutes the devastating power of an atomic weapon.  
	

	If every atom were fissionable, there would be no stability to matter and the world would be
	an uninhabitable chaos of energy transformations.  Thus, only certain isotopes of few atoms 
	will undergo a fissile chain reaction.  Nobel physicist Neils Bohr discovered that Uranium,
	the ninety-second element, is an example of a fissionable atom.[4] the predominant form of 
	uranium has a mass number of 238 and is relatively stable; U-235, a rare isotope, easily 
	undergoes nuclear fission and can sustain a chain reaction.  If a neutron traveling at 
	adequate velocity and the appropriate angle collides with a uranium-235 nucleus, the unstable
	nucleus absorbs the neutron, consequently increasing to an exceedingly unstable state.   
	Instantly the U-236 splits into two atoms of different elements, emitting 2 neutrons that 
	carry on the chain reaction, and liberating large quantities of gamma radiation.  
	

	Subsequent to John Dunning and Eugene Booth�s successful separation of uranium 235 from 
	uranium 238 in 1941 [5], uranium became the leading example for fission research.  As 
	scientists probed further into the capabilities of fission, they began to visualize, as 
	Fermi did, the awesome destructive potential of only a minute mass of uranium 235.  Thus, the
	dream of a weapon with unmitigated atomic power was spawned.
	

	With this basic knowledge of atomic chemistry and the motivation of a world crisis, the 
	Manhattan project began in 1942.  Two prominent challenges delayed the successful unleashing
	of nuclear energy: processing of sufficient fissionable material, and the actual design of a 
	nuclear bomb that would maintain and maximize a fissile chain reaction.  Dunning and Booth 
	managed to separate the two isotopes of uranium before the institution of the Manhattan 
	project, proving that it was indeed possible.  But the level at which their research was 
	performed was purely scientific; a project tasked with ending a world war required much more
	intensive and efficient processing.  Additionally, no one had any experience constructing a 
	dimensionally-feasible nuclear reactor in deployable size. 
	

	As the Manhattan team quickly learned, the relative abundance of uranium 235 was not only 
	extremely small, but when found, uranium ore was nearly impossible to purify into U-235.  
	Natural uranium ore is comprised of a mixture of isotopes 235 and 238.  Typically, one 
	percent of the mass of uranium ore being considered is composed of the unstable isotope, 
	while the rest is relatively useless U-238.[6] Therefore, to develop the prophesized weapon, 
	engineering innovations were essential.  Ernest O. Lawrence of the University of California, 
	Berkeley developed the first technique to isolate a practical amount of uranium 235, using a 
	modified mass spectrometer.[7]  Lawrence�s method dealt with the electromagnetic properties 
	of atoms, an integration of chemistry and physics.     
	

	Uranium 235 is a lighter isotope than Uranium 238.  Thus, when equal physical forces act on 
	atoms of U-235 and U-238, the isotopes will behave simply as two different masses.  Therefore,
	as Newton�s laws describe, the force acting on the lighter mass will show greater affect on 
	the motion of the mass than the force acting on the heavier mass.  In Lawrence�s apparatus, 
	the magnetic force exerted by an electromagnetic arch attracted the electrically charged 
	portions of atoms, and thus, uranium atoms traveled along the raised arc.  Uranium 235 atoms,
	naturally lighter than the stable isotope, would pass closer to the magnetic tract than the 
	heavier U-238 atoms, and could thus be collected.  To mobilize the uranium atoms into gaseous
	particles, fluorine gas was circulated over solid uranium ore, creating uranium tetrachloride
	gas.  The gaseous particles were then passed across the arc multiple times, each trial 
	gaining a more purified sample of uranium 235 tetrachloride.
	

	To Lawrence�s chagrin, his method of uranium purification proved largely inefficient.  Due to
	high maintenance costs and the time-consuming nature of the process, only one gram of uranium
	235 was harvested after millions of dollars spent in production and repairs.[8] Lawrence�s 
	design was quickly abandoned.  
	

	General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project, purchased land in Oak Ridge, 
	Tennessee to pursue another proposed method of uranium separation.  Centered on the theory of
	gaseous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride, principles of chemistry and physics were again 
	assimilated in an attempt to accomplish a feat of engineering.  Similarly, the technique 
	Groves pursued dealt with the motions of particles of different masses.  When contained in a 
	porous vessel, gaseous particles will randomly collide and bounce until passing through a 
	pore in the container � a process known as effusion.  At constant temperature, all gaseous 
	particles have equal kinetic energies, and therefore, through the properties of 
	thermodynamics, less-massive particles move with higher velocity than heavier particles.  
	When applied to effusion, lighter gases travel across a porous membrane faster than heavier 
	gases.  Uranium 235 hexafluoride, the lighter of the two isotopic gases, diffuses faster than 
	U-238 hexafluoride.  Over intervals of time, Groves concluded, this process could be used to 
	separate uranium isotopes.  
	

	The foremost problem with this technique was the quality of materials used in construction.  
	The masses of the two isotopes of uranium are so similar that the diffusion must be run in 
	completely airtight conditions.  Grease could not be used to seal the miles of tubing, 
	however, because uranium hexafluoride reacts so quickly with organic compounds.  Thus, 
	materials engineering was incorporated to fabricate new plastics to assemble the contraption.
	The engineering efforts resulted in an effective material known as Teflon.[9] Higher 
	quality porous membranes were essential to the process as well.  The final product was a 
	$100,000,000 facility consisting of thousands of consecutive membranes and diffusion tanks 
	across miles of Teflon tubing � an engineering masterpiece.[10] Due to restrictions of the 
	budget, however, construction on the Oak Ridge plant was only carried far enough to produce a
	mixture of the two isotopes, half stable, half unstable.[11] This end product was 
	subsequently fed into other series of separation techniques, becoming the main source of 
	U-235. 
	

	Following Bohr�s discovery of fissionable uranium in 1941, Glen Seaborg capitalized on years 
	of research by the discovery of the ninety-fourth element, plutonium.[12] Later, in 1942, 
	another team of researches concluded that, although not as fissile as uranium 235, an isotope
	of plutonium, Pu-239 could sustain a chain reaction.[13]  Furthermore, it was found that 
	uranium 238, if exposed to alpha particles (Helium nuclei) in a reactor for extended periods 
	of time, could actually increase in atomic number to become plutonium 239.  The discovery of 
	this correlation between stable uranium and fissionable plutonium led to rapid advances in 
	the production of atomic weaponry: not only was another fissile material available, but a 
	method for its accumulation was already conceived.
	
Engineering the Gadget

	Although the problem of understanding, processing, and purifying fissionable materials was 
	solved, the actual design of a working bomb had yet to be determined.  To date, all nuclear 
	reactors were much too large and uncontrollable to be released as an aerial bomb.  If the 
	gadget did not meet certain dimensional specifications, then it would not function correctly.
	If released, it was essential that the bomb detonated � Germany was simultaneously conducting
	research on atomic power, and it would prove disastrous for stores of fissionable material to
	fall into the enemies� hands.  Conversely, if not constructed properly, fission could occur 
	at such a rapid rate that the bomb would be uselessly nondestructive.  Thus, the Manhattan 
	team now faced a challenge of mechanical construction and calculations.	
	

	A specific mass of fissionable material, termed the �critical mass,� is necessary to begin 
	and maintain a nuclear chain reaction.  Critical mass is calculated as the ratio between 
	volume, density, and surface area, such that during the reaction, released neutrons collide
	with fissionable nuclei more often than they escape from the mass, ensuring that a chain 
	reaction occurs.[14] If an amount greater than the critical mass, a �supercritical mass,� 
	reacts, then the chain reaction will begin and end so quickly (in millionths of a second), 
	that the net energy released from the reaction will be far less than the theoretical 
	potential.[15]  Additionally, critical mass of a fissionable material can only exist for a 
	fraction of a moment due to the material�s instability.  Thus, enough neutrons must collide 
	with nuclei at exactly the instant critical mass is attained to create a nuclear chain 
	reaction.  
	

	The first design for a feasible atomic bomb was based upon using uranium 235 in a gun-type 
	detonator.  The basis for the bomb was the collision and fusion of two sub-critical masses of
	U-235 by conventional, external explosions into one, critical mass.  A sphere of uranium 235 
	was the heart of the bomb.  A section of the inner core of the sphere was removed and placed 
	far away from its complementary mass.  This inner section, the �bullet�, was then surrounded 
	with explosives so that when detonated, the blast would propel the bullet into its target, 
	the larger sphere of uranium.  At this point, neutrons would collide with nuclei from the 
	explosion and critical mass obtained. 
	

	Plutonium 239, a less fissionable substance than uranium 235, required a different design to 
	function as the fissile material of an atomic bomb.  Scientist Seth Neddermeyer conceived the
	basics behind a workable plutonium bomb built upon implosion.[16] Neddermeyer showed that 
	upon beginning of the fission reaction, a core of plutonium would expand and the reaction 
	would quickly diminish.  Consequently, the volume of the plutonium mass must remain constant 
	for fission to continue to its optimal capacity.  Thus, an original sphere composed of 
	beryllium and polonium (both radioactive elements), surrounded by equally spaced sections of 
	Pu-239 was placed at the center of the bomb.  This core was then surrounded by traditional 
	explosives.  Upon detonation, the force of the outer explosion would propel the sub-critical 
	plutonium fragments together, resulting in a critical mass with fixed volume do to external 
	pressure of the surrounding explosions.  
	

	Certain components were common in both implosion and gun-type bombs.  A uranium 238 tamper, 
	or shell, surrounded the fissionable critical mass in both bombs, functioning to deflect any 
	stray neutrons back into the chain reaction.  Both weapons also contained machinery to 
	measure the air pressure during their descent (thus making them altimeter bombs), ensuring 
	that the bomb would take no damage upon impact with the ground and maximizing range of 
	destruction.  Specific materials were used to construct the intricacies of each weapon as 
	well, such as lead to absorb radioactive emission from the fissionable material to protect 
	all of the bomb�s components. 
	

	Finally, as the summer of 1945 approached, years of engineering efforts and studies were 
	finalized into Little Boy, a uranium gun assembly bomb, and Fat Man, a plutonium implosion
	bomb.  Mechanical, chemical, civil, materials, and electrical engineering collaborated with 
	the fields of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to further previous knowledge, discover the
	unknown, and make history, a tremendous scientific engineering success.  
	
Significance of Communication

	Communication played both a scientifically positive and morally negative role throughout the 
	production of the first atomic weapons.  Scientifically, it was only through the interaction 
	among dozens of professionals from all scientific, physical, and mathematical fields that 
	gave birth to the atomic bombs.  Lack of communication, however, and an outright isolation of
	the project scientists from the military�s exact intentions bred bitterness and regret amid 
	many.  Regardless of this and whether guilt loomed in the minds of scientists towards the 
	final weeks, the original goal of the Manhattan project was ultimately realized and surpassed
	because of scientific and mathematical brilliance as well as coordinated research and 
	development.  	
	

	Departmental rivalry and personal pride fueled much of the findings leading up to the 
	creation of atomic weapons.  A prime example of this is the work of Ernest Lawrence, creator 
	of the first attempted large-scale separation of uranium ore.  Lawrence had his dreams set 
	upon being appointed as the project director and Berkeley laboratories becoming the center of
	atomic and nuclear research.  Thus, upon completion of his modified mass spectrometer, 
	Lawrence instantly promoted his innovation and himself, spreading his findings.  Although not
	directly cooperative, this breed of scientific greed led to much interaction between 
	scientists.  
	

	An even more prominent source of collaboration and communication was the overall work of the
	Los Alamos lab.  When General Groves repositioned the heart of the atomic research in the 
	isolated New Mexico lab, brilliant minds from all reaches of the nation and refuges from 
	diverse countries of Europe were brought together to bounce ideas off of one another and pick
	at the inner-thoughts of everyone present.  Such a gathering of enlightened thinkers 
	naturally led to heightened communication and productivity, unquestionably accelerating the 
	research performed.  
	

	While communication led to the overall scientific triumph of the Manhattan project, an 
	intentional lack of communication between military and government superiors and the Los 
	Alamos laboratory led to one of the most devastating moral disasters of the twentieth century.
	Aside from scientific curiosity, the main motivation of the Manhattan project scientists 
	throughout the duration of the development of the atomic bomb was a fear of a 
	nuclear-empowered Hitler.  The scientists reasoned that if the United States was the first 
	major power to wield atomic weapons, then peace could be brought to the world and Hitler�s 
	reign stopped short of attacking Americans.  On May 5, 1943, however, five members of the 
	Military Police Committee, including director General Leslie Groves, met to discuss possible 
	targets of the developing weapon.  Germany was instantly ruled out for fear of the bomb 
	malfunctioning and Hitler gaining control of the precious fissionable material.  Consequently,
	from May fifth until the end of World War II, Japan was the sole target of nuclear strike, a 
	fact everyone was ignorant to.[17]
	
Morality of the Manhattan Project

	The Manhattan project was undeniably a scientific success.  Whether the United States was 
	justified in its actions pertaining to the use of atomic warfare in World War II is still 
	inconclusively debated to this day.  The school of thought that scolds both the scientists 
	and their superiors for irresponsible action cite all of the other possibilities that existed
	the summer of 1945 other than atomic weaponry.  Those who morally support the decisions of 
	President Truman justify the creation and use of the bomb as the least devastating of options
	available.  In the end, it is impossible to determine who was right and what would have been 
	best for humanity, let alone whether delaying the harnessing of nuclear fission would have 
	accomplished anything.  One can only study each presented case and speculate based on 
	personal morals and conviction.
	
Against the Use of Atomic Weaponry

	In early 1945, during the final stages of bomb development, political clouds covering the 
	eyes of the project scientists began to clear as they realized that Japan was the prime 
	target for nuclear bombardment.  Germany had already agreed to terms of unconditional 
	surrender, and Japan was retreating from its Pacific empire.  The question of who would win 
	the war was no longer at stake, only how long the Japanese would hold out.  On June 11, 1945, 
	a document entitled �Report of the Committee on Political and Social Problems,� better known
	as the Franck Report, found its way to government hands.[18] In the report, various 
	scientists of the Manhattan Project vehemently argued against the use of what they had worked
	so diligently to create.  The scientists reasoned that although America was the atomic leader
	of the world at the time, their dominance was only assured for a few years, whereupon every 
	major national power would house weapons of mass devastation.  The committee argued that 
	America�s large stock of poisonous gas could have been utilized at the beginning of America�s
	involvement to shorten the length of the war, yet it was not for ethical reasons, and that 
	atomic weaponry should not be used for those same reasons.  The report went on to offer 
	alternatives to deploying atomic weapons, such as demonstrating the capability of an atomic 
	bomb to world powers before using one, as well as waiting for the USSR to enter the war to 
	aid in the invasion of Japan. 
	
For the Use of Atomic Weaponry

	Several factors led to the final decision of employing the atomic bomb on Japan.  It was 
	feared that the USSR under Stalin would attempt to expand its communist power if the war was
	allowed to continue.  The Japanese also denied demands for unconditional surrender on 
	numerous occasions.  Scientist James Byrnes logically deduced that, ��if the Japanese were 
	told that the bomb would be used on a given locality, they might bring our boys who were 
	prisoners of war to that area� If we were to warn the Japanese of the new highly destructive 
	weapon in the hope of impressing them and if the bomb then failed to explode, certainly we 
	would have given aid and comfort to the Japanese militarists.�[19] 
	

	Whether it was morally right or not to drop two atomic bombs on Japan in the month of August,
	1945, nuclear weaponry would still be in existence today.  An arms race would always have 
	ensued, no matter when the first bomb was developed.  Such is the nature of humanity: 
	continual curiosity and lack of responsibility.  Thus, the Manhattan Project can be viewed
	as a success, with or without regard to ethics; a group set out with a mission, and in the 
	end, everyone�s expectations were exceeded.  Fields of science and engineering, including 
	mathematics, physics, chemistry, materials, civil, and mechanics were all advanced.  The 
	Manhattan Project was a positive incident in the history of humanity. 
	
Conclusion

	The Manhattan Project integrated all scientific and engineering fields and was responsible 
	for truly beginning the �Atomic Age.�  Throughout the three-year endeavor, invaluable 
	discoveries were made concerning bomb dynamics and mechanics, materials and plastics, atomic 
	particles, nuclear fission and the beginnings of fusion, uranium, plutonium, and the
	efficiency of collaboration among multiple scientists and field leaders.  Although the goal 
	of the program was not morally humane, the project certainly achieved and surpassed 
	everyone�s ambitions.  Whether the bombs� employment and the execution of hundreds of 
	thousands of Japanese lives were necessary will never be known.  But the research completed 
	in the 1940�s on atomic energy continues to show significance and promise in today�s world 
	and will persist to play an increasingly important role in America�s history � yet another 
	reason why the Manhattan Project is the epitome of scientific engineering success.
