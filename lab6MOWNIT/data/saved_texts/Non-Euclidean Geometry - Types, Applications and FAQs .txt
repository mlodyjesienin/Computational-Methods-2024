It discusses the shape and structure of different geometrical figures. Greek mathematician Euclid employed a type of geometry, which studies the plane and solid figure of geometry with the help of theorems and axioms. It is known as Euclidean geometry. Non Euclidean geometry is the opposite of euclidean geometry. Non Euclid geometry is a part of non Euclid mathematics. It discusses the hyperbolic and spherical figures. It is also known as hyperbolic geometry. The figures of non-Euclidean geometry do not satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate. It is the main reason for the existence of non-Euclidean geometry. In this article, we are going to discuss non-Euclidean geometry in detail. Invention of Non Euclidean GeometryGreek mathematician Euclid presented the concept of Euclidean geometry. At that time, people used to think that there is only one type of geometry called euclidean. A wrong idea was present that all the geometrical figures satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate. Here comes the concept of non euclidean geometry. The great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss realized that all the geometrical figures could not satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate. The figures that don't satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate are non euclidean. Gauss described those figures as non-Euclidean, and thus the concept of non Euclidean space arrived in geometry.Spherical and Hyperbolic Geometry Sphere and hyperbola are two significant figures of geometry. The study of the two-dimensional surfaces of the sphere is spherical geometry. Hyperbolic geometry is to study the behaviour of pseudospherical surfaces and saddle surfaces. Sphere and hyperbola are the main two figures of non Euclidean geometry. Hence, it is also known as hyperbolic geometry. Sphere, hyperbola, and other non Euclidean figures do not satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate. These are the figures of non Euclid geometry, which are different from the Euclidean figures for the theorems and axioms.Types of Non Euclidean Geometry In geometry, two types of figures are there based on Euclid's parallel postulate. The figures that do not satisfy the parallel postulate are non euclidean. These figures are mainly of two types – hyperbola and ellipse. Non Euclidean geometry is classified based on the shape of the figures, elliptical geometry, and hyperbolic geometry. These two branches discuss the characteristics of the respective figures.Hyperbolic Geometry for DummiesHyperbolic geometry is a branch of non Euclidean geometry. It is not valid for the fifth parallel postulate of Euclid. The fifth postulate states that one given line is parallel with only one other line through a point, not a line. There are at least two lines in hyperbolic geometry that are parallel with a given line through a point, not a line. The properties of a triangle are different from the Euclidean geometry. The sum of angles in Euclidean geometry is 180. The sum of angles of a triangle is less than 180 degrees in this branch. The area and surface formulas of hyperbolic geometry are different from the Euclidean geometry. Elliptical GeometryAnother type of non Euclid geometry is elliptical geometry. It is the study of the figures created on the surface of an ellipse. It doesn't satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate. It studies three-dimensional figures, unlike Euclidean geometry. Elliptical geometry has a considerable application in cosmology, astronomy, and navigation. It is used in linear algebra, arithmetic geometry, and complex analysis. For accurate calculation of area, angle, distance on the earth, elliptical geometry is used. The triangles in elliptical geometry act like a non euclidean geometry triangle. The sum of these angles of these triangles is 180°.Applications of Non Euclidean GeometryNon Euclidean geometry has a considerable application in the scientific world. The concept of non Euclid geometry is used in cosmology to study the structure, origin, and constitution, and evolution of the universe. Non Euclid geometry is used to state the theory of relativity, where the space is curved. The measurement of the distances, areas, angles of different parts of the earth is done with the help of non Euclidean geometry. Also, non Euclid geometry is applied in celestial mechanics.Did You Know? The way to build space in non Euclidean geometry is called non Euclidean architecture. As soon Euclidean figures do not satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate, they create some unique figures. These figures bring variety to the architecture. The architecture includes all the various figures that are different from the regular Euclidean figures. Non Euclidean architecture is used in creating models, designing different shapes and figures. It makes some new and elegant models and sculptures.Recently Updated PagesFactors of 29 | How to Find the Factors of 29How Can We Round off to the Nearest Tens in Maths?Matchstick Patterns - Learn and Solve QuestionsSieve of Eratosthenes - Method to Find Prime Numbers with Solved ExamplesFactors of 78 | Learn and Solve QuestionsFactors for 225 - Definition, Methods, Solved Examples and FAQsFactors of 29 | How to Find the Factors of 29How Can We Round off to the Nearest Tens in Maths?Matchstick Patterns - Learn and Solve QuestionsSieve of Eratosthenes - Method to Find Prime Numbers with Solved ExamplesFactors of 78 | Learn and Solve QuestionsFactors for 225 - Definition, Methods, Solved Examples and FAQs12Trending topicsTo The Beat of The Clock - The AM and PM1 Billion in Rupees11 to 20 Spelling for Kids - Number Names for KidsXXXVII Roman Numeral - Conversion, Rules, Uses, and FAQsHow to Calculate the Percentage of Marks?Types of AnglesTrillionList of Composite Numbers from 1 to 100Temperature ConversionTo The Beat of The Clock - The AM and PM1 Billion in Rupees11 to 20 Spelling for Kids - Number Names for KidsXXXVII Roman Numeral - Conversion, Rules, Uses, and FAQsHow to Calculate the Percentage of Marks?Types of AnglesTrillionList of Composite Numbers from 1 to 100Temperature Conversion123Other PagesStatistics For Class 10HCF and LCM of Two PolynomialsInverse Laplace TransformQueuing TheoryBisection MethodHow to Convert Fractions Into Whole Numbers?Statistics For Class 10HCF and LCM of Two PolynomialsInverse Laplace TransformQueuing TheoryBisection MethodHow to Convert Fractions Into Whole Numbers?12FAQs on Non-Euclidean Geometry1.

Describe the Concept of Non Euclidean Mathematics.Ans: Greek mathematician Euclid employed the concept of Euclidean geometry. This branch of geometry is to study the plane and solid figure of geometry. The figures of Euclidean geometry satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate. There are some figures in geometry, which don't satisfy the parallel postulate. Those figures are called non Euclidean. The study of non Euclidean figures is known as non Euclidean geometry. The great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss brought the concept of non Euclidean geometry. It includes the study of hyperbola, ellipse, sphere, and other non Euclidean. Non Euclidean geometry has vital applications in cosmology, celestial mechanics, complex analysis, and arithmetic geometry. Study materialNCERTNCERTNCERT SolutionsNCERT Solutions for Class 12NCERT Solutions for Class 12 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 PhysicsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 ChemistryNCERT Solutions for Class 12 BiologyNCERT Solutions for Class 12 Business StudiesNCERT Solutions for Class 12 EconomicsNCERT Solutions for Class 12 AccountancyNCERT Solutions for Class 12 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 12 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 11NCERT Solutions for Class 11 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 PhysicsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 ChemistryNCERT Solutions for Class 11 BiologyNCERT Solutions for Class 11 Business StudiesNCERT Solutions for Class 11 EconomicsNCERT Solutions for Class 11 AccountancyNCERT Solutions for Class 11 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 11 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 10NCERT Solutions for Class 10 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 10 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 10 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 10 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 10 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 9NCERT Solutions for Class 9 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 9 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 9 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 9 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 9 HindiNCERT Solutions for Class 8NCERT Solutions for Class 8 MathsNCERT Solutions for Class 8 ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 8 EnglishNCERT Solutions for Class 8 Social ScienceNCERT Solutions for Class 8 HindiNCERT BooksNCERT Books Class 12NCERT Books Class 11NCERT Books Class 10NCERT Books Class 9NCERT Books Class 8Reference book solutionsReference Book SolutionsHC Verma SolutionsRD Sharma SolutionsRS Aggarwal SolutionsNCERT Exemplar SolutionsLakhmir Singh SolutionsDK Goel SolutionsTS Grewal  SolutionsSandeep GargCompetitive ExamsCompetitive ExamsJEE MainJEE AdvancedNEETOlympiad PreparationNDAKVPYNTSECBSECBSECBSE SyllabusCBSE Sample PaperCBSE WorksheetsCBSE Important QuestionsCBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10CBSE Important FormulasICSEICSEICSE SolutionsICSE Class 10 SolutionsICSE Class 9 SolutionsICSE Class 8 Solutions State boardsState BoardsAP BoardBihar BoardGujarat BoardKarnataka BoardKerala BoardMaharashtra BoardMP BoardRajasthan BoardTelangana BoardTN BoardUP BoardWB BoardFree Study MaterialFree Study MaterialPrevious Year Question PapersSample PapersJEE Main Study MaterialsJEE Advanced Study MaterialsNEET Study MaterialsOlympiad Study MaterialsKids LearningAsk QuestionsImportant SubjectsPhysicsBiologyChemistryMathsEnglishCommerceGeographyCivicsRevision NotesRevision NotesCBSE Class 12 NotesCBSE Class 11 NotesCBSE Class 10 NotesCBSE Class 9 NotesCBSE Class 8 Notes JEE MAINJEE MainJEE Main Important QuestionsJEE Main Important ChaptersJEE Main NotesJEE Main FormulasJEE Main Difference betweenJEE Main SyllabusJEE Main Physics SyllabusJEE Main Mathematics SyllabusJEE Main Chemistry SyllabusJEE Main Previous Year Question PaperJEE ADVANCEDJEE AdvancedJEE Advanced Important QuestionsJEE Advanced Important ChaptersJEE Advanced NotesJEE Advanced FormulasJEE Advanced Difference betweenJEE Advanced SyllabusJEE Advanced Physics SyllabusJEE Advanced Mathematics SyllabusJEE Advanced Chemistry SyllabusJEE Advanced Previous Year Question Paper NEETNEETNEET Important QuestionsNEET Important ChaptersNEET NotesNEET DiagramsNEET Difference betweenNEET SyllabusNEET Physics SyllabusNEET Chemistry SyllabusNEET Biology SyllabusNEET Previous Year Question Paper OFFLINE CENTRESMuzaffarpurChennaiBangalorePatialaDelhiHyderabadVijayawadaVisakhapatnamTiruchirapalliMadurai CoimbatorePuneNagpurGunturAurangabadRaipurBhilaiBilaspurSrinagarJammuBhubaneswarJhunjhunu © 2024.Vedantu.com.
