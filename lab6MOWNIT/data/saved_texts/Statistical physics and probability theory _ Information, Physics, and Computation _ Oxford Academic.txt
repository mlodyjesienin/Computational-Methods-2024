Abstract
This chapter introduces the basic concepts of statistical physics. The restrictive point of view adopted here keeps to classical (non-quantum) statistical physics and treats it as a branch of probability theory. The mechanism of phase transitions is described in the context of magnetic systems: ferromagnets and spin glasses.
