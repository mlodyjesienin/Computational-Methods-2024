                                                                            Linear algebra comes in handy when we need to work with a set of points represented in multi-dimensional space. Use this course to explore how systems of linear functions and equations can be represented using linear algebra. Examine how to define and compute the addition, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product operations on vectors, and discover how these operations are required while working with matrices. This course will also help you explore matrix multiplication, the inverse and transpose of a matrix, and computing the determinant of a matrix. By the time you finish this course, you will be able to express a system of linear functions as a matrix and perform fundamental operations on matrices, including matrix multiplication and the computation of inverses and determinants.
