Frequently Asked Questions



Who was Euler and what did he do?

Euler was an 18th-century, Swiss-born mathematician. He created and expanded on many mathematical theorems, identities, numbers, and more, throughout nearly all fields of mathematics.



What is Euler best known for?

Euler is best known for inventing functional notation, f(x), as well as developing the trigonometric functions to represent sine, cosine, and tangent. He then formulated the identify showing the relation between them and exponential functions, known as Euler's Formula. Furthermore, when pi is inputted into this formula, the solution includes Euler's number, i, pi, and 1.



How did Euler go blind?

Euler first went blind in his right eye as a result of an illness he had suffered. Years later, another illness befell him, resulting in the loss of his other eye, leaving him totally blind.

Leonhard Euler



Leonhard Euler was one of the world's greatest mathematical minds. Euler's contributions to mathematics during his time led to the advancement of complex analysis, number theory, combinatorics, analytical theory, topology, and much more.

Swiss-Born 18th Century Mathematician Leonhard Euler.







Born in Basel, Switzerland, in the year 1707, Leonhard Euler began his love of mathematics at an early age. At 13, Euler started attending the University of Basel where he studied mathematics under Johann Bernoulli. After receiving his master's degree in philosophy, Euler left Basel for St. Petersburg, Russia. There, in 1729, he found work as a professor at the Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences with Johann Bernoulli son's, Nicholas and Daniel Bernoulli. During his time there, Euler simplified analytical and mathematical operations, as well as advanced the theory of both trigonometric and logarithmic functions.In 1738, Euler caught a fever and lost sight in his right eye. This did not slow him down, however, and in 1740, Euler moved to Germany to become the director of mathematics at the Berlin Academy. Over the next 25 years, even after completely going blind in 1771, Euler would write some of his most important and well-known mathematical publications. In one such text, Introductio in analysin infinitorum, he defines and uses functions as the foundation for complex mathematical analysis, which is still a concept used today. Another text, Elements of Algebra, became one of the most read books on mathematics in history.

Over his lifetime, Euler made many significant contributions to various fields of mathematics, including:

Introducing and conceptualizing functions for mathematical and complex analysis.
Using exponential functions and logarithmic functions to analytically prove mathematical conjectures.
Inventing functions for sine, cosine, and tangent.
Discovering the relationships between trigonometric functions and exponential functions.
Finding relationships between trigonometric functions and complex numbers.
Inventing the calculus of variations in mathematical analysis.
Creating an entirely new branch of mathematics, Analytic Number Theory, by uniting the fields of complex analysis and number theory.

Constants and Theorems Named After Euler





The Euler Angles used in Eulers Rotation Theorem.






Due to Leonhard Euler's vast contributions to almost all fields of mathematics, there have been many mathematical constants, theorems, formulas, and identities that have been named after him. These include:Constants
Euler's Number, {eq}e = 2.71828... {/eq}, the base of a natural logarithm.

Euler's Constant (also called the Euler-Mascheroni Constant), {eq}\gamma \approx 0.5772... {/eq}, which is the limiting difference between the harmonic series and natural logarithm.

Euler-Gompertz Constant, {eq}\delta \approx 0.596347... {/eq}, used within certain integral calculations and continued-fraction approximations.
Theorems
Euler's Theorem, used in number theory, which states that if n and a are positive coprime integers, and {eq}\varphi(n) {/eq} is Euler's Phi Function, then {eq}a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n {/eq}.

Euler's partition theorem, used in combinatorics and number theory, states that the amount of partitions of an integer, n, into odd parts, is equal to the number of partitions of n into distinct parts.
Euler's rotation theorem, used in geometry, states that there are exactly three parameters (also called Euler's Angles) to describe a rotation of any three-dimensional geometric shape.
The Euclid-Euler theorem, which connects Mersenne primes to perfect numbers, states that an even number is perfect if it can be written as {eq}2^{p - 1} (2^p - 1) {/eq}.


Euler's quadrilateral theorem proves the relationship between the diagonals of a convex quadrilateral and its sides.
Euler's homogeneous function theorem shows that a homogeneous function is a linear combination of its partial derivatives.
Formulas & Identities
Euler's Formula: {eq}e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta {/eq}, along with a special case known as Euler's Identity: {eq}e^{i\pi} = 1 {/eq} or {eq}e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0 {/eq}, when {eq}\theta = \pi {/eq}.

The Euler Characteristic: {eq}\chi = V - E + F {/eq} and Euler's polyhedron formula: {eq}2 = V - E + F {/eq}, both used in graph theory and topology to describe the shape or structure of non-convex, convex, and spherical polyhedra.

Euler's Totient Function (also called Euler's Phi Function) is a method for determining the amount of relatively prime numbers there are between 1 and some other number, n, represented by {eq}\varphi(n) {/eq}.

Euler's Criterion is a formula in number theory that is used to compute whether or not a residue class a modulo p, where p is prime, is a quadratic residue.
Euler's Four Square Identity defines that a product of two numbers can be written as the sum of four squares when both multipliers can also each be written as the sum of four squares: {eq}({a_1}^2+{a_2}^2+{a_3}^2+{a_4}^2)({b_1}^2+{b_2}^2+{b_3}^2+{b_4}^2) = \\ (a_1b_1-a_2b_2-a_3b_3-a_4b_4)^2 + (a_1b_2+a_2b_1+a_3b_4-a_4b_3)^2 + (a_1b_3+a_3b_1+a_4b_2-a_2b_4)^2 + (a_1b_4+a_4b_1+a_2b_3-a_3b_2)^2 {/eq}

Lesson Summary



Leonhard Euler, born at the beginning of the 18th century, in Basel, Switzerland, was one of the most important and greatest contributors to the study, innovation, and advancement of mathematics in our history. He graduated from the University of Basel where he studied mathematics under the tutelage of Johann Bernoulli. He worked as a professor, and eventual director, of mathematics for universities in Russia, Germany, and Switzerland. In fact, Euler's first job as a professor of mathematics was in St. Petersburg, Russia. Twice in his life, he contracted illnesses that would eventually leave him blind. However, Euler never let this get in his way of creating new mathematical ideas, constructs, functions, notations, etc.; always contributing to mathematics until his passing.
Best known for introducing the world to mathematical functions (along with their standard notation of f(x)), Euler would go on to also create and define the trigonometric functions that are used to this very day, to calculate for the sine, cosine, or tangent of an angle. He then determined the equation that relates trigonometric and exponential functions, known as Euler's Formula: {eq}e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta {/eq}, along with a special case known as Euler's Identity: {eq}e^{i\pi} = 1 {/eq} or {eq}e^{i\pi} - 1 = 0 {/eq}, when {eq}\theta = \pi {/eq}. Euler also contributed greatly to number theory, including first formulating the law of quadratic reciprocity, introducing Euler's Theorem, Euler's Phi Function, and Euler's Criterion. He also defined constants that are still being used and implemented today, such as Euler's Number, {eq}e {/eq}, as the base of a natural logarithm, and Euler's Constant (also called the Euler-Mascheroni Constant). Furthermore, Euler developed a method for the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations, now known as Euler's Method.

Who Was Leonhard Euler?Why do mathematicians represent imaginary numbers using the symbol i? Why are functions usually written as f(x)? Today, we take this standard system of notation and symbols for granted. However, it wasn't always like this! It took the work of one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Leonhard Euler, to standardize and invent most of the mathematical notation that we use today. 

   Leonhard Euler 
 





We still use the notation and symbols developed by Euler, and that alone is a huge accomplishment. However, Euler was also one of the most important mathematicians of his time, and his groundbreaking work remains important even today. 
 Early Life and EducationLeonhard Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland in 1707. His father, Paul Euler, was educated at the University of Basel. Although he was a minister and not a mathematician, he studied under one of the great mathematicians of the time, Jacob Bernoulli. Euler's father even lived in Bernoulli's house and studied with his son Johann while they were both students. When Euler was a child, he learned the basics of mathematics from his father, but his family expected him to enter the ministry. However, Euler was more interested in reading mathematics books than the Bible, and becoming a minister was not something he really wanted to do. At fourteen years old, he enrolled in the University of Basel to study theology, but he quickly convinced his father's old friend Johann Bernoulli--now a renowned mathematics professor--to give him some private lessons. Bernoulli quickly recognized the enormous talent of the young Euler, and convinced Paul Euler to allow his son to switch from theology to mathematics. Euler graduated in 1726 at only nineteen years old, and by the time he graduated, he had already published his first paper. The next year, he published another paper and won second place in the competition for the Grand Prize of the Paris Academy, which was a major accomplishment for such a young mathematician. He would later win the Paris prize twice, in 1738 and 1740. Work in St. PetersburgAlthough he wanted to stay close to home in Switzerland, Euler was unable to find a position at the university. Instead, he accepted a position as a professor in the newly formed St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, Russia. He arrived in St. Petersburg in May of 1727, and it was here that he would do much of his most revolutionary work. Initially, Euler worked for the Russian navy as well as at the academy, but in 1730, he was given a full time position as a professor of physics. Then, in 1733, he became a senior professor of mathematics at only 26 years old. Euler would spend most of his life in St. Petersburg, and during this time he published 380 papers. He defined the trigonometric functions sine, cosine, and tangent; combined and improved on the early forms of calculus developed by Leibniz and Newton; and did work in fields ranging from optics, musical analysis, and acoustics. He introduced many new forms of mathematical notation, including the use of f(x) for functions, the symbol i for imaginary numbers, and the symbol e for the base of the natural logarithm. Personal LifeIn 1734, Euler married Katharinia Gsell, who was also a Swiss expatriate living in St. Petersburg. They had thirteen children total, but only five survived. Not long after his marriage, Euler began to suffer from problems with his eyesight that would plague him for the rest of his life. After he recovered from a fever in 1735, the vision in his right eye was damaged. It got progressively worse over the next few years, and by 1766, he was almost entirely blind. 


Even with this serious limitation, he continued to work. He published many of his most important papers during this time, although he received a lot of assistance from his two sons and various colleagues at the Academy. Euler eventually died in 1783 in St. Petersburg due to a brain hemorrhage. He continued to work until the very end of his life, and had enough unpublished papers that the St. Petersburg Academy was able to continue publishing his work for almost fifty years after he died. Euler's FormulaEuler developed a relationship between the exponential function (e) and the trigonometric functions sine and cosine, which ultimately was one of his most important contributions.  

  Eulers Formula
 





 Now known as Euler's Formula, this simple relationship has proven to be very important in many fields of mathematics, science, and engineering. When x = pi, then Euler's formula can be simplified to what is known as Euler's identity.  

  Eulers Identity
 





 Because it simply demonstrates the relationship between these fundamental mathematical constants, Euler's identity has proven to be one of the most important equations in all of mathematics. Lesson SummaryLeonhard Euler (1707-1783) was an important and prolific mathematician. He is responsible for introducing and standardizing mathematical notation, developing many new equations and formulas, and contributing to almost every field of mathematics. Two of his biggest accomplishments were the development of Euler's formula and Euler's identity. Euler was born in Basel, Switzerland, but spent most of his life living and working in St. Petersburg, Russia. He published more than 380 papers during his lifetime, and had enough unpublished work already completed at the time of his death that additional papers were published for almost another fifty years later.
