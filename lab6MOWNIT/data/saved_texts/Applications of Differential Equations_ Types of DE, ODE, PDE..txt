The degree of a differential equation is defined as the power to which the highest order derivative is raised.Ordinary differential equations are applied in real life for a variety of reasons. They are used in many applications like to explain thermodynamics concepts, the motion of an object to and fro like a pendulum, to calculate the movement or flow of electricity. Also, in the field of medicine, they are used to check bacterial growth and the growth of diseases in graphical representation.Application Of First Order Differential EquationIn order to explain a physical process, we model it on paper using first order differential equations. Many cases of modelling are seen in medical or engineering or chemical processes. The three most commonly modelled systems are:PopulationIn order to illustrate the use of differential equations with regard to population problems, we consider the easiest mathematical model offered to govern the population dynamics of a certain species.you can also read about Matrices hereFalling ObjectsThe acceleration of gravity is constant (near the surface of theearth). So, for falling objects the rate of change of velocity is constant. {dv\over{dt}}=gMixing ProblemsMixing problems are an application of separable differential equations. They’re word problems that require us to create a separable differential equation based on the concentration of a substance in a tank.Application Of Second Order Differential EquationA second-order differential equation involves two derivatives of the equation. Many engineering processes follow second-order differential equations. The three most commonly modeled systems are:Simple Harmonic Motion{d^2x\over{dt^2}}=−kmx. This is the differential equation for simple harmonic motion with n2=km. Hence, the period of the motion is given by 2πn. We can conclude that the larger the mass, the longer the period, and the stronger the spring (that is, the larger the stiffness constant), the shorter the period.Bonds between atoms or moleculesChemical bonds are forces that hold atoms together to make compounds or molecules. Chemical bonds include covalent, polar covalent, and ionic bonds. They are represented using second order differential equations.Systems of the electric circuitSystems of the electric circuit consisted of an inductor, and a resistor attached in seriesA circuit containing an inductance L or a capacitor C and resistor R with current and voltage variables given by the differential equation of the same form. The second order of differential equation represent derivatives involve and are equal to the number of energy storing elements and the differential equation is considered as ordinaryLearn about Solution of Differential EquationsCommon Applications of Differential Equations in PhysicsWe learnt about the different types of Differential Equations and their applications above. Now let’s briefly learn some of the major applications. The major applications are as listed belowNewton’s law of Cooling / WarmingNewton’s empirical law of cooling states that the rate at which a body cools is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the body and that of the temperature of the surrounding medium, the so-called ambient temperature. Let T(t) be the temperature of a body and let T(t) denote the constant temperature of the surrounding medium.Then the rate at which the body cools is denoted by \({dT(t)\over{t}}\) is proportional to T(t) – TA. This means that\({dT\over{t}}=k(T(t) – T_A)\)where k is a constant of proportionality. The value of the constant k is determined by the physical characteristics of the object.


If the object is large and well-insulated then it loses or gains heat slowly and the constant k is small. If the object is small and poorly insulated then it loses or gains heat more quickly and the constant k is large.We assume the body is cooling, then the temperature of the body is decreasing and losing heat energy to the surrounding. Then we have \(T >T_A\). Thus \({dT\over{t}}\) < 0. Hence the constant k must be negative.If the body is heating, then the temperature of the body is increasing and gain heat energy from the surrounding and \(T < T_A\). Thus \({dT\over{t}}\) > 0 and the constant k must be negative is the product of two negatives and it is positive.Under Newton’s law of cooling, we can Predict how long it takes for a hot object to cool down at a certain temperature. Moreover, we can tell us how fast the hot water in pipes cools off and it tells us how fast a water heater cools down if you turn off the breaker and also it helps to indicate the time of death given the probable body temperature at the time of death and current body temperature.Newton’s Law of Cooling leads to the classic equation of exponential decay over timewhich can be applied to many phenomena in science and engineering including the decay in radioactivity.\({dT\over{t}}=k(T – T_A)\)\({dT\over{(T – T_A)}}=kdt\)\(ln{|T – T_A|}=kt+c_1\) where c_1 is a constant\(|T – T_A|=e^{kt+c_1}\)Hence \( T(t)= T_A+ c_2e^{kt}\) where c_2 is a constantWhen the ambient temperature T_A is constant the solution of this differential equation is\( T(t)= T_A+ c_2e^{kt}\),This equation represents Newton’s law of cooling.Learn more about Logarithmic Functions here.Population GrowthIn order to illustrate the use of differential equations with regard to population problems, we consider the easiest mathematical model offered to govern the population dynamics of a certain species. One of the earliest attempts to model human population growth by means of mathematics was by the English economist Thomas Malthus in 1798. Essentially, the idea of the Malthusian model is the assumption that the rate at which a population of a country grows at a certain time is proportional to the total population of the country at that time. In mathematical terms, if P(t) denotes the total population at time t, then this assumption can be expressed as\({dP\over{T}}=kP(t)\)where k is called the growth constant or the decay constant, as appropriate.Solution of the equation will provide population at any future time t. This simple model which does not take many factors into account (immigration and emigration, for example) that can influence human populations to either grow or decline, nevertheless turned out to be fairly accurate in predicting the population.The differential equation \({dP\over{T}}=kP(t)\), where P(t) denotes population at time t and k is a constant of proportionality that serves as a model for population growth and decay of insects, animals and human population at certain places and duration.It is fairly easy to see that if k > 0, we have grown, and if k <0, we have decay.This is a linear differential equation that solves into \(P(t)=P_oe^{kt}\)where the initial population, i.e. \(p(0)=p_o\), and k are called the growth or the decay constant.Therefore, we conclude the following: if k>0, then the population grows and continues to expand to infinity, that is, \(\lim_{t{\rightarrow}\infty}\) if k<0, then the population will shrink and tend to 0. In other words, we are facing extinction. Bernoulli’s EquationBernoulli’s principle states that an increase in the speed of a fluid occurs simultaneously with a decrease in static pressure or a decrease in the fluid’s potential energy.Bernoulli’s principle can be applied to various types of fluid flow, resulting in various forms of Bernoulli’s equation.Bernoulli’s principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid along a streamline is the same at all points on that streamline. This requires that the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy and internal energy remains constant.Consider the differential equation given by\(y’+P(x)y=Q(x)y^n\)This equation is linear if n=0 , and has separable variables if n=1,Thus, in the followingdevelopment, assume that n≠0 and n≠1. Begin by multiplying by y^{-n} and (1-n) to obtain\(y^{-n}y’+P(x)y^{1-n}=Q(x)\)


\((1-n)y^{-n}y’+(1-n)P(x)y^{1-n}=(1-n)Q(x)\)\({d\over{dx}}[y^{1-n}]+(1-n)P(x)y^{1-n}=(1-n)Q(x)\)which is a linear equation in the variable \(y^{1-n}\). Letting \(z=y^{1-n}\) produces the linear equation.\({dz\over{dx}}+(1-n)P(x)z=(1-n)Q(x)\)Finally, the general solution of the Bernoulli equation is\(y^{1-n}e^{\int(1-n)p(x)ax}=\int(1-n)Q(x)e^{\int(1-n)p(x)ax}dx+C\)Newton’s Second Law of MotionNewton’s Second Law of Motion states that If an object of mass m is moving with acceleration a and being acted on with force F then Newton’s Second Law tells us.F = maTo see that this is in fact a differential equation we need to rewrite it a little. First, remember that we can rewrite the acceleration, a, in one of two ways.\(a={dv\over{dt}}={d^2u\over{dt^2}}\)Where v is the velocity of the object and u is the position function of the object at any time t. We should also remember at this point that the force, F may also be a function of time, velocity, and/or position.So, with all these things in mind Newton’s Second Law can now be written as a differential equation in terms of either the velocity, v, or the position, u, of the object as follows.\(m{dv\over{dt}}=F(t,v)\)\(m{du^2\over{dt^2}}=F(t,v,{du\over{dt}})\)Exponential Growth of BacteriaIn the biomedical field, bacteria culture growth takes place exponentially. For exponential growth, we use the formula;\(L(t)= L_0e^{kt}\)Let \(L_0\) is positive and k is constant, then\({dL\over{dt}}=k\)L(t) increases as time increases.\(L_0\) is the value when t=0L is the exponential growth model.Exponential Reduction or Radioactivity Decay\(N(t)=N_0e^{-kt}\)When \(N_0\) is positive and k is constant, N(t) decreases as the time decreases,\({dL\over{dt}}=-k\)R is the exponential reduction model.Applications of Differential Equations in Real LifeDifferential equations find application in: In the field of medical science to study the growth or spread of certain diseases in the human body.
