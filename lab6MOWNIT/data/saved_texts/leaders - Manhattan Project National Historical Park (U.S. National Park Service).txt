The Manhattan Project employed more than 500,000 people from all walks of life during a five-year period. From the hills of East Tennessee to the isolated plateaus of New Mexico to the arid expanse of eastern Washington, this revolutionary scientific undertaking forever changed the world. The complexity and size of the Manhattan Project required leaders on many different fronts. Political leaders shaped the Manhattan Project through their decisions and priorities. Military leaders guided the project from start to finish. Scientific leaders led the research, and civilian leaders ensured the day-to-day operations. But how did such a large project maintain secrecy, security, and efficiency? Who was ultimately in charge? Learn more about the leaders of the Manhattan Project below.
