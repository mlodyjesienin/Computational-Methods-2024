OverviewTest SeriesPrime numbers have attracted human attention from the early days of civilization. One of the most interesting things about prime numbers is their distribution among natural numbers. Prime Number is a part of the number system. An understanding of them is basic mathematics and is an important topic of algebra. There are 5 properties of natural numbers: Closure Property, Commutative Property, Associative Property, Identity Property and Distributive Property.What are Prime Numbers?
Prime Number is a positive integer that is not divisible without remainder by any integer except itself and 1. A prime number cannot be divided by any other numbers without leaving a remainder. It is a number that cannot be factored in. Prime numbers are a subset of natural numbers. For example, the only divisors of 13 are 1 and 13, making 13 a prime number, while the number 24 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24, making 24, not a prime number. Positive integers other than 1 which are not prime are called composite numbers.
Properties of Prime Numbers
Some of the important properties of prime numbers are given below:

A prime number is a composite number greater than 1. Hence, while dividing the prime number we always get the reminder 1.
Prime Number has exactly two factors, that is, 1 and the number itself.
There is one and only one even prime number, that is, 2.
1 is neither prime nor composite.
When a set of integers or numbers has only number 1 as the common factor then they are known as Co-Prime Numbers. Hence, any two prime numbers are always co-prime to each other.
Every number can be expressed as the product of prime numbers.
Every even integer bigger than 2 can be split into two prime numbers, such as 6 = 3 + 3 or 8 = 3 + 5.

Smallest Prime Number: 2 is the smallest prime number. It is also the only even prime number.
Largest Prime Number: The largest known prime number is \(2^{82,589,933} − 1\), a number that has 24,862,048 digits when written in base 10. Before then the largest known prime number was \(2^{77,232,917}-1\), having 23,249,425 digits.UGC NET/SET Course Online by SuperTeachers: Complete Study Material, Live Classes & MoreGet UGC NET/SET SuperCoaching @ just₹27999₹12249 Your Total Savings ₹15750 Explore SuperCoachingWant to know more about this Super Coaching ?

Parity is the property of an integer of whether it is even or odd. An integer’s parity is even if it is divisible by two with no remainders left and its parity is odd if it isn’t; that is, its remainder is 1. Let’s see how we can distribute them as Odd and Even Prime Numbers.
Odd Prime Number: Except for the number 2, all prime numbers are odd, since an even number is divisible by 2, which makes it composite. Hence, the distance between any two prime numbers in a row is at least 2. They are called successive or consecutive prime numbers.
Even Prime Number: There is one and only one even prime number, that is, 2.
Find Prime Numbers using Divisibility Test
To prove whether a number is a prime number, follow the steps below:
Step 1: First try dividing it by 2. Use the test for divisibility of 2.
Step 2: See if you get a whole number. If you do, it can’t be a prime number.
Step 3: If you don’t get a whole number, next try dividing it by prime numbers: 3, 5, 7, 11 (not by 9 as 9 is divisible by 3) by using their divisibility test and so on, always dividing by prime numbers. See if you get a whole number. If you do, it can’t be a prime number.
Find Prime Numbers Greater than 40
If you need to list out all the prime numbers greater than 40, use the formula \(n^2 + n + 41\). All you need to do is put all the whole numbers in place of ‘n’ one by one.
However, this formula will only give you all the prime numbers greater than 40.
Put n = 0 \(0^2 + 0 + 41 = 0 + 41 = 41\)
Put n = 1 \(1^2 + 1 + 41 = 2 + 41 = 43\)
Put n = 2 \(2^2 + 2 + 41 = 6 + 41 = 47\)
Find Prime Numbers Except 2 or 3
There is a simple formula to calculate prime numbers other than 2 and 3. We can use the formula \(6n \pm 1\).
Put n = 1, \(6(1) \pm 1\) = 5 and 7.
Put n = 2, \(6(2) \pm 1\) = 11 and 13.

Find Prime Numbers using Sieve of Eratosthenes
Eratosthenes was one of the greatest scholars of the Hellenistic period, who lived a few decades after Euclid. He served as the chief librarian in the library of Alexandria. He designed a clever way to find all the prime numbers up to a given number. Since this method is based on the idea of sieving (sifting) the composite numbers, it is called the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Here’s a demonstration of the sieve of Eratosthenes.

Circle the number 2, since it is the first prime number, and then erase all its higher multiples, namely all the composite even numbers.
Move on to the next non-erased number, the number 3. Erase all its higher multiples of 3 too.
Repeat the same texts for the next non-erased numbers.

Other Types of Prime Numbers
 
There are some other kinds of prime numbers that have special definitions and applications. Let’s see them one by one.
Gaussian Prime Number: There is another kind of Prime Number called Gaussian Prime Number.
The Gaussian Prime Numbers are Gaussian integers z=a+bi satisfying one of the following properties.

If both a and b are nonzero then, a+bi is a Gaussian prime if \(a^2+b^2\) is an ordinary prime.
If a=0, then bi is a Gaussian prime if and only if |b| is an ordinary prime and |b|= 3 (mod 4).
If b=0, then a is a Gaussian prime if and only if |a| is an ordinary prime and |a|= 3 (mod 4).

Mersenne Prime Number: A Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. That is, it is a prime number of the form \(M_n = 2^n − 1\) for some integer n. They are named after Marin Mersenne, a French Minim friar, who studied them in the early 17th century. If n is a composite number then so is \(2^n − 1\).
The search for Mersenne primes is an active field in number theory and computer science. It is also one of the major applications for distributed computing, a process in which thousands of computers are linked through the Internet and cooperate in solving a problem.
Fermat Prime Number: A Fermat number, named after Pierre de Fermat.
\(\begin{matrix}
{\displaystyle F_{n}=2^{2^{n}}+1,}\\
\text{ The Fermat numbers satisfy the following recurrence relations }\\
{\displaystyle F_{n}=(F_{n-1}-1)^{2}+1}\\
{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{0}\cdots F_{n-1}+2}{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{0}\cdots F_{n-1}+2}\\
\text{ for n } \geq 1,\\
{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+2^{2^{n-1}}F_{0}\cdots F_{n-2}}{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}+2^{2^{n-1}}F_{0}\cdots F_{n-2}}\\
{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}^{2}-2(F_{n-2}-1)^{2}}{\displaystyle F_{n}=F_{n-1}^{2}-2(F_{n-2}-1)^{2}}\\
\end{matrix}\)

What are Co Prime Numbers?
When a set of integers or numbers has only number 1 as the common factor then they are known as Co-Prime Numbers. It means that the Highest Common Factor or HCF should be 1 for those numbers. Hence, any two prime numbers are always co-prime to each other. Co-prime number is also called a relatively prime or mutually prime number. There is an interesting property of co-prime numbers. The sum of any two co-prime numbers is coprime with their product.
Properties of a Co Prime Numbers
The properties of a Co Prime Number are given below:

The number 1 is, by definition, co-prime with every number.
Any two prime numbers are always co-prime to each other. As discussed earlier, prime numbers always have two factors. They are 1 and the number itself. So, the common factor between two prime numbers will always be 1.

Example: 3, 7 (Factors of 3 are 1, 3 and Factors of 7 are 1, 7. So 3, 7 are Prime Factors.)

Any two consecutive integers or numbers will always be Co Prime numbers since the successive numbers’ HCF will be always 1.

Example: {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,4}, {4,5}, {5,6} and so on.

Any two even numbers can never be co-prime numbers since the even numbers will always have 2 as their common factor.
If two numbers or integers have their unit number as 0 and 5, they cannot be co-prime numbers as they will always have 5 as their common factor.

Example: {30, 35} cannot be co-prime numbers since both the numbers are divisible by 5.

Difference Between Prime and Composite Numbers
Prime numbers and composite numbers differ based on the number of factors they have. There are many other differences between these two types of numbers. They are essentially opposite of each other in mathematical terms. Let’s see their differences in detail.




Prime Numbers
Composite Numbers


Prime Numbers have only two factors, 1 and the number itself.
Composite numbers can have more than two factors.


Prime number pairs always make coprime numbers.
Any two even numbers can never be co-prime numbers.


Prime numbers are always odd numbers, except 2.
Composite numbers can be even or odd depending upon the factors they have.


Prime Numbers have prime factors except 1 which is neither prime nor composite.
If a composite number has a minimum of one even number, it will be an even number. If it has no even number in its factors, then it will be an odd number.


Prime numbers become rarer and rarer as numbers get larger.
Composite numbers are more as the number line moves towards the right.



Solved Examples of Prime Numbers
Here are some solved examples of prime numbers:
Example 1: Number of Prime between 1 to 100 is …………
Solution: There are 25 prime numbers under 100. The list of prime numbers between 1 to 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.
Example 2: Is 51 a prime number?
Solution: Let’s use the divisibility test on 51.
Divisibility Test of 2: It does not end with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Hence, it is not divisible by 2.
Divisibility Test of 2: To check the divisibility by 3, we need to add the digits of the number 51. 5 + 1 = 6. 6 is divisible by 3. Hence, 51 is divisible by 3. 3 x 17 = 51
Thus, 51 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 3 and 17, as well as by itself and 1. ie it has four factors.
