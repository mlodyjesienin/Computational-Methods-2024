The Manhattan Project and the Second World War,

                  The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the
                  surrender of Japan
                  were the last acts of the Second World War.  The most
                  destructive weapon in the history of combat had helped bring
                  an end to the most destructive conflict in human
                  history.  
                

The Manhattan Project and the devastation that its successful
                  outcome wrought are inexplicable outside the context of the
                  Second World War.  The project began as a race to acquire
                  the bomb
                  before Nazi Germany did, and the prospects of an atomic bomb in the hands of one of
                  the world's most oppressive and murderous regimes were
                  chilling indeed.  In a war initiated
                  by German aggression and dreams of conquest, tens of millions
                  died.  Few European nations escaped grievous injury, but
                  nowhere was the suffering worse than in Poland, where six
                  million or more lost their lives, and in the Soviet Union,
                  where more than 25 million may have died.  Other Allies
                  suffered terribly as well, including about 600,000 deaths in
                  France and 400,000 dead Britons (including many in the Pacific
                  Theater).  Approximately six million Jews of all nations
                  died during the Holocaust.  Even small and too often
                  forgotten nations suffered horribly.  In Yugoslavia, for
                  example, as many as two million people may have died during
                  the war.  Germany itself lost over four
                  million.  The stakes in the race for the bomb were
                  thus very high.  Tens of million more might have died --
                  and Western civilization itself might have been eclipsed -- if
                  Germany had proven the victor.
                

                  The loss of life in the Pacific war was equally
                  horrific.  Victims of Japanese aggression suffered
                  terribly, from Korea to the Philippines to Southeast Asia to
                  the islands of the Pacific.  The nation hardest hit,
                  however, was probably China.  Beginning with the invasion
                  by Japan in 1931, perhaps 15 million Chinese died at the hands
                  of the Japanese Army or from the war's attendant starvation
                  and disease.  The toll on Asia and the Pacific was
                  psychological as well as physical; controversy still rages
                  over the numerous war crimes committed by the Japanese Army,
                  including biological warfare experiments conducted on
                  civilians, the execution of prisoners of war, and wholesale
                  rape and murder committed against entire cities, such as
                  happened in 1937 in the Chinese city of Nanking where 200,000
                  or more Chinese civilians may have died.  Well over two
                  million Japanese soldiers and civilians lost their lives
                  during the war, of which perhaps as many as 300,000, or even
                  more, were as a result of the two atomic bombings.  About
                  300,000 Americans died during the wars against Germany and
                  Japan.  Though no one will ever know for certain, the
                  worldwide death toll for the war from 1931 to 1945 probably
                  reached 60 million.
                

The atomic bomb was the scientific and technological
                  exclamation point at the end of this worst-of-all wars that
                  was won by technologically-advanced industrial might. 
                  That the bomb was completed by the United States in time to
                  help finish the conflict is remarkable.  Most of the
                  theoretical breakthroughs in nuclear physics that made it
                  possible dated back less than twenty-five years, and, with new
                  findings occurring faster than they could be absorbed by
                  practitioners in the field, many fundamental concepts in
                  nuclear physics and chemistry had yet to be
                  confirmed by laboratory experimentation.  Nor was there
                  any conception initially of the design and engineering
                  difficulties that would be involved in translating what was
                  known theoretically into working devices capable of releasing
                  the enormous energy of the atomic nucleus in a predictable
                  fashion.  The industrial base created in a handful of
                  years to transform these theories into reality was, by 1945,
                  comparable in size to the American automobile industry. 
                  Approximately 130,000 people were employed by the project at
                  its peak, from laborers to Nobel Prize winners.  The
                  Manhattan Project was as much a triumph of engineering and
                  industry as of science.
                

Without the leadership of Leslie Groves and
                  Robert Oppenheimer, as well as that of
                  Crawford Greenewalt of DuPont and other contractors, the
                  revolutionary breakthroughs in nuclear science achieved by
                  Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr,
                  Ernest Lawrence, and their colleagues would
                  not have produced the atomic bomb during World War II. 
                  Despite numerous obstacles, the United States was able to
                  combine the forces of science, government, academia, the
                  military, and industry into an organization that took nuclear
                  physics from the laboratory and on to the battlefield with a
                  weapon of awesome destructive capability, making clear the
                  importance of basic scientific research to national
                  defense.  The Manhattan Project became the organizational
                  model behind the remarkable achievements of American "big
                  science" during the second half of the twentieth
                  century.  When President John F. Kennedy announced his
                  goal of putting a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s, it
                  was the Manhattan Project that he invoked for its spirit of
                  commitment and patriotism.
