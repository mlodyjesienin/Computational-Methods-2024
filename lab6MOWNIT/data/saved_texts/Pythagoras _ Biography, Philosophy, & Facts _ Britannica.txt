				Top Questions
			What was Pythagoras’s profession? When and how did it begin?Pythagoras was a Greek philosopher and mathematician. He seems to have become interested in philosophy when he was quite young. As part of his education, when he was about age 20 he apparently visited the philosophers Thales and Anaximander on the island of Miletus. Later he founded his famous school at Croton in Italy.AnaximanderLearn about the philosophy of Anaximander.What was Pythagoras known for?Pythagoras himself came up with the theory that numbers are of great importance for understanding the natural world, and he studied the role of numbers in music. Although the Pythagorean theorem bears his name, the discoveries of the Pythagorean theorem and that the square root of 2 is an irrational number were most likely made after his death by his followers.Pythagorean theoremLearn about the history of the Pythagorean theorem.When and where was Pythagoras born? When did Pythagoras die?Pythagoras was born about 570 BCE on the island of Samos. He died at Metapontium, in modern-day Italy, about 500 to 490 BCE. In one version of his life, he died after being expelled from Croton (where he had founded his school) by a revolt against him and his followers; the revolt was led by Cylon, an influential man in Croton who had been rejected by Pythagoras for admission to his school.What was Pythagoras’s religion?It is difficult to speak about Pythagoras’s religion since he left no writings behind. However, the Pythagoreans believed that after death the human soul is reincarnated in other animals and thus that all living things have a certain kinship. Pythagoras’s followers championed certain forms of religious observance: for example, they did not eat beans, they performed sacrifices and entered temples barefoot, and they wore white clothing.PythagoreanismLearn more about Pythagoreanism.Pythagoras (born c. 570 bce, Samos, Ionia [Greece]—died c. 500–490 bce, Metapontum, Lucanium [Italy]) was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and founder of the Pythagorean brotherhood that, although religious in nature, formulated principles that influenced the thought of Plato and Aristotle and contributed to the development of mathematics and Western rational philosophy. (For a fuller treatment of Pythagoras and Pythagorean thought, see Pythagoreanism).PythagorasPythagoras demonstrating his Pythagorean theorem in the sand using a stick. (more)Little of what is known about Pythagoras comes from contemporary accounts, and the first fragmentary accounts of his life came in the fourth century bce, about 150 years after his death. Pythagoras was born in Samos and likely went to Egypt and Babylon as a young man. He emigrated to southern Italy about 532 bce, apparently to escape Samos’s tyrannical rule, and established his ethico-political academy at Croton (now Crotone, Italy). Because of anti-Pythagorean feeling in Croton, he fled that city in 510 bce for Metapontum (now Metaponto, Italy) where he died.

Ancient Greece


It is difficult to distinguish Pythagoras’s teachings from those of his disciples. Pythagoras himself likely wrote no books, and Pythagoreans invariably supported their doctrines by indiscriminately citing their master’s authority. Pythagoras, however, is generally credited with the theory of the functional significance of numbers in the objective world and in music. Other discoveries often attributed to him (the incommensurability of the side and diagonal of a square, for example, and the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles) were probably developed only later by the Pythagorean school. More probably, the bulk of the intellectual tradition originating with Pythagoras himself belongs to mystical wisdom rather than to scientific scholarship.
