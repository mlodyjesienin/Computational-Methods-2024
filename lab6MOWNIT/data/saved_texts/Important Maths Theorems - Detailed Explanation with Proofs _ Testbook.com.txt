OverviewTest Series
Mathematical theorems are integral to the field of mathematics, with every branch boasting a plethora of established principles put forth by renowned mathematicians worldwide. This article provides a comprehensive list of crucial mathematical theorems for students between classes 6 to 12. These theorems are fundamental in laying a strong foundation in basic mathematics.
A mathematical statement can only be considered a theorem if it has been proven. The act of proving these theorems not only confirms their truth but also aids in the development of logical thinking and reasoning skills, thereby minimizing mathematical errors.A Comprehensive List of Mathematical Theorems

A mathematical theorem can be defined as a statement that is accepted as true based on previously accepted statements, mathematical operations, or arguments. Every mathematical theorem has a corresponding proof that justifies its validity.
The Importance of Theorems in Mathematics
Theorems are considered as the absolute truths in mathematics. They not only facilitate the problem-solving process but also, through their proofs, help students gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. For students, theorems form the bedrock of basic mathematics and assist them in developing deductive reasoning once they fully comprehend the statements and their proofs.Get Pass ProNewAll-in-One Pass For All Your ExamsAlso IncludesAll Test SeriesPrev.

In Class 10, students encounter several important theorems that serve as the foundation for many mathematical concepts. To score well in the board exams and strengthen their knowledge base in the subject, Class 10 students are expected to thoroughly learn all the theorems, their statements, and proofs. Some of the significant mathematical theorems for Class 10 are listed below.
Key Class 10 Mathematical Theorems
For Class 10, some of the most notable theorems include:

Pythagoras Theorem
Midpoint Theorem
Remainder Theorem
Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Angle Bisector Theorem
Inscribed Angle Theorem
Ceva’s Theorem
Bayes’ Theorem

Apart from these, the lessons that contain the most crucial theorems are those on circles and triangles. Some key theorems for Class 10 on these topics are given below.Test Series20.3k Users MH-SET (Assistant Professor) Test Series 2021 31 Total Tests | 1 Free Tests English 8 Previous Year Paper20 Subject Test3 Full TestView Test Series16.5k Users All SET Exams Mock Test 109 Total Tests | 1 Free Tests English,Hindi 10 Subject Test30 Chapter Test6 Full Tests+63 more testsView Test Series10.4k Users MAHA TAIT 2023 Mock Test 14 Total Tests | 1 Free Tests English,Marathi 4 Sectional Test4 Mini Full Test3 Full Test+3 more testsView Test SeriesCircle Theorems for Class 10
There are several theorems related to circles that are important for both Class 9 and 10 students. Some of these include:

Theorem 1:  Equal chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the center of the circle.
Converse of Theorem 1:  If two angles subtended at the center by two chords are equal, then the chords are of equal length.
Theorem 2:  The perpendicular to a chord, when drawn from the center of the circle, bisects the chord.
Converse of Theorem 2:  A straight line passing through the center of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord.
Theorem 3:  Equal chords of a circle are equidistant from the center of the circle.
Converse of Theorem 3:  Chords of a circle, which are at equal distances from the center, are equal in length.
Theorem 4:  The measure of angles subtended to any point on the circumference of the circle from the same arc is equal to half of the angle subtended at the center by the same arc.
Theorem 5:  The opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary.
Triangle Theorems for Class 10

All congruent figures are similar, but the converse is not always true.
Two polygons with the same number of sides are similar if their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are in the same ratio.
Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are in the same ratio.
In two triangles, if the corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are in the same ratio, then the two triangles are similar.
In two triangles, if the sides of one of the triangles are proportional to the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal, and the two triangles are similar.
Proof of Theorems
Theorem 1: 
If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle and intersects the other two sides, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.
Construction:  Let's consider triangle ABC, with DE a line parallel to BC, intersecting AB at D and AC at E, i.e., DE || BC. Join C to D and B to E. Draw EM ⊥ AB and DN ⊥ AC.

We need to prove that AD/DB = AE/EC.
Proof: 
The area of triangle ADE = ½ × AD × EM, and the area of triangle BDE = ½ × DB × EM. Similarly, the area of triangle ADE = ½ × AE × DN, and the area of triangle DEC = ½ × EC × DN. Hence, the area of triangle ADE to the area of triangle BDE = ½ × AD × EM to ½ × DB × EM = AD to DB. The area of triangle ADE to the area of triangle DEC = AE to EC. Since triangles DEC and BDE are on the same base, i.e., DE, and between the same parallels, DE and BC, their areas are equal. Hence, AD/DB = AE/EC. This proves the theorem.
Theorem 2: 
If a line divides any of the two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then that line is parallel to the third side.
Let's consider triangle ABC, in which DE divides AC and AB in the same ratio. This implies that AB/DB = AE/EC.

Construction: Draw a line DE’ from point D to E’ at AC such that DE’//BC.
Proof: 
To prove: If DE` || BC, then AB/DB = AE`/E`C. According to the theorem, AB/DB = AE/EC. Then, accordingly, E and E` must coincide, proving that DE || BC.
Theorem 3: 
In two triangles, if the sides of one triangle are proportional to the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding angles are equal, and the two triangles are similar. This is also called the SSS (side-side-side) criterion.
Let's consider two triangles ABC and DEF that are drawn such that their corresponding sides are proportional, i.e., AB/DE = AC/DF = BC/EF.
Proof: 
To prove: ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, and ∠C = ∠F, hence triangle ABC ~ DEF. In triangle DEF, draw a line PQ so that DP = AB and DQ = AC. Since the corresponding sides of the two triangles are equal, DP/PE = DQ/QF = PQ/EF, meaning that ∠P = ∠E and ∠Q = ∠F. We had taken ∠A=∠D, ∠B=∠P, and ∠C=∠Q. Hence, ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, and ∠C = ∠F. Therefore, from the AAA criterion, triangle ABC ~ DEF.
Theorem 4: 
Pythagoras Theorem:  In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
Hypotenuse  2  = Base  2  + Perpendicular  2 
Proof: 
Let's consider triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B. BD is perpendicular to hypotenuse AC, drawn from vertex B.

To prove: AC  2  = AB  2  + BC  2 
In triangle ABC and ADB, AB/AC = AD/AB, meaning that AB  2  = AC × AD. In triangles ABC and BDC, BC/AC = CD/BC, meaning that BC  2  = AC × CD. When we add these two equations, we get AB  2  + BC  2  = AD × AC + CD × AC = AC (AD + CD) = AC  2  . Hence, proved.
