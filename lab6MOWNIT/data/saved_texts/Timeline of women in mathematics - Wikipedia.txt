From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



This is a timeline of women in mathematics.


Timeline[edit]
Classical Age[edit]
Before 350: Pandrosion, a Greek mathematician known for an approximate solution to doubling the cube and a simplified exact solution to the construction of the geometric mean.[1]
c. 350–370 until 415: The lifetime of Hypatia, a Greek Neoplatonist philosopher in Roman Egypt who was the first well-documented woman in mathematics.[2]
18th Century[edit]
1748: Italian mathematician Maria Agnesi published the first book discussing both differential and integral calculus, called Instituzioni analitiche ad uso della gioventù italiana.[3][4]
1759: French mathematician Émilie du Châtelet's translation and commentary on Isaac Newton’s work Principia Mathematica was published posthumously; it is still considered the standard French translation.[5]
c. 1787 – 1797: Self-taught Chinese astronomer Wang Zhenyi published at least twelve books and multiple articles on astronomy and mathematics.[6]
19th Century[edit]
1827: French mathematician Sophie Germain saw her theorem, known as Sophie Germain's theorem, published in a footnote of a book by the mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre.[7][8] In this theorem Germain proved that if x, y, and z are integers and if x5 + y5 = z5 then either x, y, or z must be divisible by 5. Germain's theorem was a major step toward proving Fermat's Last Theorem for the case where n equals 5.[7]
1829: The first public examination of an American girl in geometry was held.[9]
1858: Florence Nightingale became the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society.[10]
1873: Sarah Woodhead of Britain became the first woman to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos Exam, which she passed.[11]
1874: Russian mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya became the first woman in modern Europe to gain a doctorate in mathematics, which she earned from the University of Göttingen in Germany.[12]
1880: Charlotte Angas Scott of Britain obtained special permission to take the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos Exam, as women were not normally allowed to sit for the exam. She came eighth on the Tripos of all students taking them, but due to her sex, the title of "eighth wrangler," a high honour, went officially to a male student.[13] At the ceremony, however, after the seventh wrangler had been announced, all the students in the audience shouted her name. Because she could not attend the award ceremony, Scott celebrated her accomplishment at Girton College where there were cheers and clapping at dinner, and a special evening ceremony where the students sang "See the Conquering Hero Comes", and she received an ode written by a staff member, and was crowned with laurels.[13]
1885: Charlotte Angas Scott became the first British woman to receive a doctorate in mathematics, which she received from the University of London.[14]
1886: Winifred Edgerton Merrill became the first American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics, which she earned from Columbia University.[15]
1888: The Kovalevskaya top, one of a brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion, was discovered by Sofia Kovalevskaya.[16][17]
1889: Sofia Kovalevskaya was appointed as the first female professor in Northern Europe, at the University of Stockholm.[12][18]
1890: Philippa Fawcett of Britain[19] became the first woman to obtain the top score in the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos Exam. Her score was 13 per cent higher than the second highest score. When the women's list was announced, Fawcett was described as "above the senior wrangler", but she did not receive the title of senior wrangler, as at that time only men could receive degrees and therefore only men were eligible for the Senior Wrangler title.[20][21]
1891: Charlotte Angas Scott of Britain became the first woman to join the American Mathematical Society, then called the New York Mathematical Society.[22]
1891: Cornelia Fabri of Italy became the first woman to earn a doctorate in math from the University of Pisa.[23]
1894: Charlotte Angas Scott of Britain became the first woman on the first Council of the American Mathematical Society.[24]
1897: Four women attended the inaugural International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich in 1897 - Charlotte Angas Scott, Iginia Massarini, Vera von Schiff, and Charlotte Wedell.[25]
20th Century[edit]
1911: Swedish mathematician Louise Petrén-Overton became the first woman in Sweden with a doctorate in mathematics.[26]
1913: American mathematician Mildred Sanderson earned her PhD for a thesis that included an important theorem about modular invariants.[27]
1918: German mathematician Emmy Noether published Noether's (first) theorem, which states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law.[28]
1927: American mathematician Anna Pell-Wheeler became the first woman to present a lecture at the American Mathematical Society Colloquium.[29][30]
1930: Cecilia Kreiger became the first woman to earn a PhD in mathematics in Canada, at the University of Toronto.[31]
1930s: British mathematician Mary Cartwright proved her theorem, now known as Cartwright's theorem, which gives an estimate for the maximum modulus of an analytic function that takes the same value no more than p times in the unit disc. To prove the theorem she used a new approach, applying a technique introduced by Lars Ahlfors for conformal mappings.[32]
1943: Euphemia Haynes became the first African-American woman to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics, which she earned from Catholic University of America.[33]
1944: Helen Walker became the first female president of the American Statistical Association.[34]
1949: American mathematician Gertrude Mary Cox became the first woman elected into the International Statistical Institute.[35] Also, Maria Laura Lopes obtained her PhD in Mathematics, being the first woman to obtain the title in Brazil.
1951: Mary Cartwright of Britain became the first female president of the Mathematical Association.[36][32]
1956: American mathematician Gladys West began collecting data from satellites at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division. Her calculations directly impacted the development of accurate GPS systems.[37]
1960s[edit]
1960 and 1966: British mathematician Lucy Joan Slater published two books about the hypergeometric functions from the Cambridge University Press.[38][39]

1964: Mary Cartwright of Britain became the first woman to be given the Sylvester Medal of the Royal Society.[40][44]
1965: Scottish mathematician Elizabeth McHarg became the first female president of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society.[45][46]
1966: American mathematician Mary L. Boas published Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, which was still widely used in college classrooms as of 1999.[47][48][49]
1968: Mary Cartwright of Britain became the first woman to be given the De Morgan Medal, the London Mathematical Society’s premier award.[50][44]
1970s[edit]

It is a professional society whose mission is to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity for and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences. It is incorporated in the state of Massachusetts.[54]
1971: The American Mathematical Society established its Joint Committee on Women in the Mathematical Sciences (JCW), which later became a joint committee of multiple scholarly societies.[55]
1973: American mathematician Jean Taylor published her dissertation on "Regularity of the Singular Set of Two-Dimensional Area-Minimizing Flat Chains Modulo 3 in R3" which solved a long-standing problem about length and smoothness of soap-film triple function curves.[56]
1974: American mathematician Joan Birman published the book Braids, Links, and Mapping Class Groups. It has become a standard introduction, with many of today's researchers having learned the subject through it.[57]
