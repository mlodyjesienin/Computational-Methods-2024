Early Life



Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine, France, on March 31, 1596. His mother died when he was very young, so he and his brothers were sent to live with his grandmother. His father believed that a good education was important, so Descartes was sent off to boarding school at a young age. 
Descartes was a good student and eventually earned a law degree at the University of Poitiers in 1616 at about 20 years of age. During this time, he began to develop a sense that it was important to use our ability to reason (or think) to discover truth. He believed reasoning should be based on evidence. Descartes is the philosopher who said, ''I think, therefore I am.''

Accomplishments & Discoveries



Descartes is considered the father of modern philosophy, a key figure in the scientific revolution of the 17th century, and a pioneer of modern mathematics. Many people also call him the father of analytic geometry, which connects the fields of algebra and geometry. This is because Descartes discovered that you can plot any two-dimensional point on a mathematical plane. A mathematical plane is made up of an x and y axis. You may have seen this before in math class. This plane is called the Cartesian plane, named for the Latin form of Descartes's last name. 
Descartes was also the first mathematician to assign the letters from the early alphabet (like a, b, c) to represent data and later alphabet letters (like x, y, z) to represent variables. If you haven't started doing math with letters yet, you probably will soon. You can thank Descartes for that! In 1619, Descartes developed four rules for deductive reasoning, or rational, scientific thinking. He used rules based on mathematical principles but applied them to all of the sciences. 
Accept nothing is true without evidence. 
Divide complex problems into their simplest parts. 
Solve the simple problems and then the complex ones. 
Recheck your thinking. 
In many ways, René Descartes was a man ahead of his time. He believed in evidence-based reasoning and religious tolerance during a time when that wasn't popular among many in Europe. He also wanted average men and women to be able to read his work; many people did not believe in the education of women during this time. He died on February 11, 1650.

Lesson Summary



René Descartes was a French mathematician, philosopher, and scientist. He developed rules for deductive reasoning, or rational, scientific thinking; developed a system for using letters as mathematical variables; and discovered how to plot points on a plane called the Cartesian plane. Without Descartes's work, the fields of mathematics, philosophy, and science might look quite different today.

Additional Activities


Prompts About the Contributions of Rene Descartes for Kids:
Timeline Prompt:
Make a timeline that lists the major events and accomplishments of Rene Descartes' life. It is ok if some of the events on your timeline do not include the exact date; just make sure the events are in chronological order.

Example: He graduated with a law degree in 1616.

Poster Prompt 1:
Create an informational poster that depicts Descartes' contributions to mathematics. Make sure your poster shows what a Cartesian plane looks like. Also make sure that it describes why Descartes is known as the father of analytic geometry and what he used letters for in math.

Tip: If you haven't started doing math problems that contain letters yet, you could ask your teacher or a parent to show you what a math problem with letters might look like.

Poster Prompt 2:
Make an informational poster that defines deductive reasoning and shows Descartes' four principles of deductive reasoning.

Example: Recheck your thinking is the last step in deductive reasoning.

Essay Prompt:
In one paragraph, write an essay that answers the following questions: In what ways is Descartes considered to have been ahead of his time? How were his ideas and beliefs different than other people's in Europe during the time that he lived?

Example: Descartes thought that women should be taught to read.
