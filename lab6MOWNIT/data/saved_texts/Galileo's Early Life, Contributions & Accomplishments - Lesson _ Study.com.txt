Galileo's Biography



Galileo was born in Pisa, Italy in 1564 and lived until 1642. He lived during a period of major historical change, known as the Renaissance. The word renaissance means rebirth and describes the period after the struggles and strife during the Dark Ages. During the Renaissance, as world exploration expanded so did international trade. Italian merchants developed wealth used to fund education, the arts, architecture, and thanks to Galileo, science and technological advances. The Renaissance was not limited to Italy, it also spread across Europe. The Renaissance influenced the Protestant Reformation, which was an expression of new ideas about religion. The Reformation also challenged the corruption and political power of the Catholic Church.Early LifeAlthough Galileo is one the most famous historical figures, he came from humble beginnings. He was the oldest of six children, his father was a musician and his mother came from a family of merchants. Though his farther was noble by birth, the family was not wealthy. However, his father was creative and intelligent. In addition to playing music, he wrote on music theory. In 1572, the family moved to Florence. At that time Florence was the center of great art, literature and cultural development. The wealthy Medici family ruled the city and supported the work of great artists and thinkers like Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo.
Influences and EducationGalileo was educated by private tutors and monks. As a young man, he even considered joining the monastery. He began studying medicine at the University of Pisa in 1580. However he never completed his degree and instead returned to Florence to study mathematics. His teacher and mentor was the Medici court mathematician: Ostilio Ricci. Under the guidance of Ricci, Galileo studied the work of Euclid, a Greek mathematician. After that, he continued independently studying ancient Greek texts, choosing to focus on the work of Archimedes. Ricci and these ancient Greek philosophers greatly influenced Galileo. Galileo was also influenced by the work of his own father, who not only played and wrote about music, but also experimented with stringed instruments. His father investigated how different amounts of tension on the strings affected the sound.Galileo's CareerAfter completing his studies, Galileo began working as a private math tutor and built up a notable reputation. In 1888, he became a professor of math at the University of Pisa. There he also studied and wrote about physics in an unpublished work called 'On Motion' and conducted his famous experiments on gravity. One such experiment included dropping sprees of different masses from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Galileo left Pisa in 1892 when he became the chair of the mathematics department at the University of Padua with the help of Christoph Clavius and Guildobaldo del Monte. Clavius was an influential math professor and Jesuit priest, a powerful and wealthy order of the Catholic Church. Galileo met him when he traveled to Rome in 1587. Del Monte was an engineer and member of the aristocracy. These men used their wealth and social status to support Galileo and his work. They greatly influenced his thinking. Galileo wrote several publications throughout his life and career. Among the most important were:
Starry Messenger: published in 1610, described his observations of the Moon, stars, and the moons of Jupiter.
Letters on Sunspots: published in 1613, describes sunspots as markings on the surface of the Sun rather than planets, as some had believed.
Diologue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems: published in 1632, is the masterwork of Galileo. It argues the Sun-centered model of the solar system over the Earth-centered model.
The Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences: published in 1638, was his final book presenting the work he had done in Physics.
After his publication of Starry Messenger in 1610, Galileo gained the patronage of the powerful ruler Cosimo de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. He was given the lifetime appointment of Chief Mathematician of the University of Pisa and Philosopher and Mathematician to the Grand Duke and moved to Florence.

Controversy with the Church



Galileo was a devout Catholic. But his writings about the Sun as the center of the known universe went against Church teachings that the Earth was at the center of the universe. In 1615, Galileo received a warning from Catholic Cardinal Bellarmine, a representative of the Pope, to stop supporting the Copernican heliocentric model by writing about it teaching it or even discussing it. From that point on, Galileo had to submit his writings to the Inquisition for approval before they could be published. The Inquisition was a church institution which carried out the violent process of persecuting heretics, people charged with not being faithful or going against the beliefs of the church. Those found guilty were put to death. The Inquisition sought to limit Galileo's work in order to prevent the spread of his ideas. In 1633, Galileo was formally charged and tried. He was allowed to plead to a charge less severe than heresy. Galileo was forced to recant his writings supporting heliocentrism in order to avoid being put to death. Instead, he was put under house arrest for the rest of his life.Later LifeGalileo continued teaching math at the University of Pisa and to private students. In addition he continued his research on the physics of motion and invented several devices. He pursued his studies of Archimedean principles and investigated the tides. He began studying astronomy more in-depth, especially with the invention of the spyglass, or telescope. Even after he was sentenced to house arrest, his work was translated into other languages and published throughout Europe. He proposed a method for determining longitude at sea for the States General of the Netherlands.Galileo never married but had three children with a woman named Maria Gamba. His two daughters both entered the convent and his son lived with him after his mother married.Galileo began having health problems shortly after being placed under house arrest. He suffered a hernia in 1634, lost his eyesight in 1637, and become seriously ill in 1638. He later died in 1642.

Galileo's Accomplishments in Astronomy



Galileo made several contributions to the field of astronomy, including:
Observations of the Moon and its phases and features
Observations of the moons of Jupiter
His discovery and description of the rings of Saturn
Observations of a supernova
His discovery of the phases of Venus
And his discovery of sunspots.
His astronomical observations and discoveries, made possible by the invention of the telescope, provided the evidence to support the Copernican, or heliocentric, model of the solar system.Galileo's View of HeliocentrismHeliocentrism is the concept that the Sun is at the center of the solar system and the planets move around it in their orbits. Galileo learned of this model from the work of Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. This model provided a more elegant explanation for the motion observed in the planets than the widely accepted Earth-centric model. This model required complicated mathematical theories to account for planetary motion. Galileo provided evidence to support the heliocentric model with his astronomical observations.

Drawing of the heliocentric model by Copernicus







Galileo's Views of PhysicsGalileo challenged established ideas of physics. For example, according to Aristotle, a lighter object like a feather or beach ball will fall slower than a heavier object like a cannon ball. Galileo argued that it was not the mass of the objects that mattered but their form or shape. Air resistance, rather than lightness, causes the beach ball to fall slower. If air resistance could be removed, he argued, the objects would fall at the same rate. Modern experiments conducted in a vacuum (chamber with no air) show this to be true. Galileo also introduced the concept of inertia to explain why a moving object would continue to move. Rather than moving toward its natural state, as was previously believed. Galileo explained that objects continue in motion until acted on by an outside force. Similarly, objects at rest require a force to begin moving. These new ideas were important because they challenged prior philosophical explanations with physical evidence.Galileo's TelescopeThough he did not invent the telescope, Galileo contributed innovations that made it more useful for studying astronomy. The first telescopes could magnify objects by three times. Galileo was able to construct a telescope that could magnify by twenty times. This allowed for direct observation of more distant objects including the Moon, stars, the Sun, and distant planets.

Galileo built this telescope that made it possible to observe distant astronomical objects.

Lesson Summary



Galileo Galilei is one of the most significant figures in human history. He lived in Italy during the Renaissance period and contributed greatly to the advancements of that period with his work in science and mathematics. He is credited with developing the experimental method for testing ideas and gathering physical evidence. With the backing of the wealthy and powerful Cosimo Medici, ruler of Florence, Galileo had a prolific writing career. He wrote many important works from his observations and theories in physics, mechanics, and astronomy.
He also invented several devices and is most known for his innovations toward the telescope, making it possible to directly observe distant astronomical objects. This allowed him to acquire evidence to support the new heliocentric, or sun-centered, model of the solar system put forward by Nikolai Copernicus. Because this model was in conflict with Catholic doctrine, Galileo was eventually convicted by the Inquisition and sentenced to house arrest for the remainder of his life. Despite the attempts of the Church to limit his work, the teachings and writings of Galileo sparked the scientific revolution that still guides human exploration and advancement today.

Who Was Galileo?When you think of science, you probably think about experiments - doing physical tests to determine how things in our world work. This scientific method only began to take shape during the 1500s and 1600s during what is called the Scientific Revolution. This was a time in which the views of the Roman Catholic Church and European society were rapidly changing. Galileo Galilei was a key individual during the Scientific Revolution, although the Church and society were not always in agreement with him. A great part of Galileo's work was challenging the ideas of Aristotle, including his theory about falling objects and his theory that the sun revolves around Earth. During Galileo's life, Aristotle's theory was challenged by Nicolaus Copernicus, who said that Earth revolves around the Sun, and Galileo helped refute Aristotle's theories and support Copernicus. But before we examine these theories, let's take a step back to the beginning. Galileo was born on February 15, 1564, in Pisa, Italy. When he was between seven and ten years old, his family moved to Florence, Italy. His intellectual talents were recognized early by his family, and because of this, when he entered the University of Pisa in 1581, his father wanted him to study medicine. However, he ultimately gave up on pursuing medicine and fully turned his attention to mathematics. He eventually held positions as a professor of mathematics at the Universities of Pisa and then Padua. Later, he landed a more prestigious job as a Court Philosopher and Mathematician to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, a member of the famous Medici family. 
 Motion of Everyday ThingsNow that we know a little bit about his life, let's look at Galileo's contributions to science. Galileo called Aristotle's ideas about physics into question. According to Aristotle, an object with more heaviness will fall to Earth faster than one with less heaviness. As an obvious example, if a beach ball and a bowling ball are dropped from the same tower at the same time, the heavier bowling ball should hit the ground much earlier. In our own real-world experience this seems to make sense, but it gets a little bit tougher when we think of a less extreme example--like how long it would take a marble and a baseball to hit the ground? In the end, Galileo concluded that it was only air resistance that caused a lighter object, like a beach ball, to take longer to fall than the heavier bowling ball. If there was no air to interfere, both objects would fall at the same rate. Galileo was able to demonstrate this principle by doing experiments with cannonballs of different weights, showing that, when dropped from the same height, they reached the ground at the same time. Galileo also figured out how fast objects accelerated when falling by putting differently-sized balls on inclined planes, or ramps. Since it took longer for the balls to roll down the ramp than just to fall through the air, he could more easily measure the time that their 'fall' took. Earlier Greek philosophers had said that objects moved until they reached their natural place, then they stopped. However, this did not sound sufficient to Galileo. Instead, he noticed that some objects kept moving even as nothing was actually pushing them. This observation that an object will keep doing whatever it was doing before until another force acts on it is called inertia and is central to modern physics. 


Further, he noticed that objects have what is known as a parabolic shape as they move, especially against gravity. By proving that they had a regular shape, Galileo realized that there could be math at play, even if he didn't have the knowledge of calculus needed to prove it. Studies of Astronomy and a Moving EarthSoon, Galileo was applying his thoughts on motion to larger objects, namely the planets. While the telescope was invented by Dutch eyeglass makers, Galileo improved the lenses so that the telescope was more effective. Once he had perfected his telescope lenses, he saw things that no one had seen before. The first thing that Galileo focused on using his telescope was the moon. He noticed that the moon was not a perfect, unchangeable sphere, but was full of mountains, valleys, and craters. He also observed the rings of Saturn and the many moons of Jupiter, which was notable because people had previously believed that only Earth had a moon. And he realized that the Milky Way was actually made up of millions of stars. Additionally, Galileo's studies of the universe led him to challenge Aristotle's theory that the sun revolved around Earth. Instead, he confirmed his belief in Copernicus's theory that Earth actually revolved around the sun, which we now know to be true! ConsequencesWhile Galileo's findings were revolutionary, the Roman Catholic Church was not so understanding. The Church was deeply suspicious of anything that did not go along with its teachings. Suggesting that Earth moved around the sun was precisely the sort of questioning of Church teachings that was not desired at this time. Galileo soon ran into serious opposition from the Inquisition, a Church movement to root out people who didn't believe in Catholic doctrine. As a result, Galileo was forced to recant his findings and remain under house arrest for the rest of his life.  Lesson SummaryIn this lesson we looked at the life and achievements of Galileo. Despite being religious, he found himself opposing Church doctrine with his belief that Earth revolved around the sun, instead of the popular belief that the sun revolved around Earth. Such controversy would lead to his house arrest. However, beyond such discord, Galileo also proposed that only air resistance affects how fast objects of different weights fall, studied acceleration of objects moving down ramps, and proposed the idea of inertia, which states that an object will stay in motion, or stay still, until another object acts on it, to make it stop or start moving. He also used the telescope to study the universe, including features of the moon, Saturn, Jupiter, and the numerous stars of the Milky Way.
