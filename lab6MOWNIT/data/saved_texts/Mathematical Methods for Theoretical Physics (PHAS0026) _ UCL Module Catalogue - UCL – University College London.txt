Description
Outline:
This module gives a basic grounding in mathematical techniques of differential equations and tensors - together with their application in fluid dynamics - that are of foundational use in theoretical physics.
Aims:
To introduce theoretically-minded students to advanced areas in mathematics, with applications to various problems in physics, particularly in dynamics, and in quantum mechanics, solid mechanics and fluid mechanics
To provide a deeper treatment of mathematical methods covered in PHAS0025 Mathematical Methods III
To provide mathematical underpinning for Theoretical Physics students taking PHAS0030 Computational Physics in term 2 of year 2.
Teaching and Learning Methodology:
This module is delivered via weekly lectures supplemented by a series of problem solving tutorials and additional discussion.
In addition to timetabled lecture and PST hours, it is expected that students engage in self-study in order to master the material. This can take the form, for example, of practicing example questions and further reading in textbooks and online.
