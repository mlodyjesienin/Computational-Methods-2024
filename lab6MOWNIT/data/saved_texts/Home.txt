It will provide a forum to learn about important themes in contemporary category theory, both from experts and from each other.Three invited speakers will each present a three-hour mini-course, accessible to non-specialists, introducing an area of active research. There will also be short talks contributed by PhD students and postdocs, and a poster session.The focus of the Spring School is on aspects of pure category theory as they interact with research in other areas of algebra, geometry, topology and logic. Any "categorical thinker" - that is, any mathematician whose work makes use of categorical ideas - is welcome to participate.Here is the conference poster.Short courses by invited speakers Grothendieck ToposesOlivia  Caramello Derived and Triangulated CategoriesGreg StevensonModel Categories and Higher Category TheoryConstanze Roitzheim Important dates Pre-registration opens: 2 September 2019Final decisions made on speakers and funding: 4 December 2019Registration opens: 4 December 2019Registration and funding  The conference is fully booked, and will not be accepting any further applications.
