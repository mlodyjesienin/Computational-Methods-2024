About this book

The book is a comprehensive, self-contained introduction to the mathematical modeling and analysis of disease transmission models. It includes (i) an introduction to the main concepts of compartmental models including models with heterogeneous mixing of individuals and models for vector-transmitted diseases, (ii) a detailed analysis of models for important specific diseases, including tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, influenza, Ebola virus disease, malaria, dengue fever and the Zika virus, (iii) an introduction to more advanced mathematical topics, including age structure, spatial structure, and mobility, and (iv) some challenges and opportunities for the future.There are exercises of varying degrees of difficulty, and projects leading to new research directions. For the benefit of public health professionals whose contact with mathematics may not be recent, there is an appendix covering the necessary mathematical background. There are indications which sections require a strong mathematical background so that the book can be useful for both mathematical modelers and public health professionals.

Reviews

“The projects and exercises at the end of each chapter are well thought and planned out, and probably my favorite part of the whole book. … I would recommend this book to anyone with the requisite mathematics background, who is more interested in the modeling aspects of epidemiology. I think it’s a nice complement to the existing literature, and I will likely be referring to it for useful examples in my own teaching.” (Roslyn Hickson, SIAM Review, Vol. 63 (3), September, 2021)“Every practicing mathematical epidemiologist will want this book to occupy a prominent place in their library.” (Glenn Ledder, MAA Reviews, June 14, 2020)“This book is suitable for upper level university students, it is also useful for public health professionals as manyof the model discussions are found accessible.” (Yilun Shang, zbMATH 1433.92001, 2020)
