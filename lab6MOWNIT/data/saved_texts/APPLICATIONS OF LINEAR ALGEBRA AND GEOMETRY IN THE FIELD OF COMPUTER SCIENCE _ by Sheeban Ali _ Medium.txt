From computer graphics and cryptography to machine learning and data analysis, these mathematical disciplines offer a solid foundation for solving complex problems and developing efficient algorithms. By leveraging the principles of linear algebra and geometry, computer scientists are able to model and manipulate data, optimize processes, and design innovative solutions that drive advancements in various domains. This report explores the applications of linear algebra and geometry in computer science, highlighting their significance and impact in shaping the modern technological landscape.1) CRYPTOGRAPHY:Cryptography refers to the encryption and decryption of sensitive information derived from mathematical concepts to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher.There are some essential concepts concerning Cryptography.Cipher : The procedure that will render a message unintelligible to the recipient. It’s also used to recreate the original message, depending on the encryption mechanism used.Plaintext: The message or information that is being encrypted.Ciphertext: The message or information that is created after the cipher has been used.Although there are different methods to encrypt and decrypt messages, we’ll focus on a linear algebra based cipher, the Hill cipher, which uses a matrix as a cipher to encode a message, and it’s extremely difficult to break when a large matrix is used. The receiver of the message decodes it using the inverse of the matrix. This first matrix is called the encoding matrix and its inverse is called the decoding matrix.Solved Example:If we want to encrypt a message, the message needs to be converted into letters into its numerical value and group them into a 3x1 matrix. Here is an example.After obtaining the newly formed matrix, multiply the matrix with the augmented matrix. The result will now be your new encrypted message.If we have to decrypt, we only require the inverse of the given matrix and the encrypted matrix. We multiply those two matrices and convert the numerical to its alphabet form and we should see the message.2) COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY:Computed tomography also known as ct scan is a tool which is used to create detailed cross section images of our body. It involves taking a series of X-ray measurements from different angles to detect abnormal tissues in our body and then using mathematical algorithms to reconstruct these measurements into a 3D image.Linear algebra plays a crucial role in CT image reconstruction. The process of ct scan can be formulated as a mathematical problem, where a set of linear equations needs to be solved to reconstruct the image. The equations relate the measured X-ray attenuation values to the unknown density values of the tissues within the body.Solved Example:Let us take a simplified example of a 2D CT image reconstruction which is solved using the basic concepts of linear algebra and matrix equation Ax=B.To start with the initial position and fire X-rays with an intensity of 30 (just a number for illustrative purposes) through the body:Initial positionAs can be seen in the picture the upper ray goes through areas 1, 2 and 3 and let’s say that the intensity value of 12 is measured on the other side of the scanner:OrThe rest of the formula is found accordingly:We then rotate the scanner for the first timePosition after first rotation which gives the following formula:And a second rotationPosition after second rotation yields the following formula:Now we are combining all three systems of equations and after solving them we will get a grayscale image.or written out in full:3) COMPUTER GRAPHICS:In Computer Graphics, matrices are used to represent many different types of data. Games that involve 2D or 3D graphics rely on some matrix operations to display the game environment and characters in game. In this paper, the process of Linear Algebra in Computer Graphics is discussed with examples from different areas of Computer Graphics. Following are some of the fundamental operations of computer graphics that are done using linear algebra.a. Translation:In Computer graphics,2D Translation is a process of moving an object from one position to another in a two dimensional plane.Explanation:Consider a point object O that has to be moved from one position to another in a 2D plane. LetInitial coordinates of the object O = (X old , Y old)New coordinates of the object O after translation = (X new , Y new)Translation vector or Shift vector = (Tx , Ty)Given a Translation vector (Tx , Ty)● Tx defines the distance the X old coordinate has to be moved.● Ty defines the distance the Y old coordinate has to be moved.Equation:This translation is achieved by adding the translation coordinates to the old coordinates of the object as:● X new = X old + Tx (This denotes translation towards X axis)● Y new = Y old + Ty (This denotes translation towards Y axis)Matrix Form:In Matrix form, the above translation equations may be represented asb. Rotation:In Computer graphics, 2D Rotation is a process of rotating an object with respect to an angle in a two dimensional plane.Explanation:Consider a point object O that has to be rotated from one angle to another in a 2D plane. Let● Initial coordinates of the object O = (X old , Y old)● Initial angle of the object O with respect to origin = Φ● Rotation angle = θ● New coordinates of the object O after rotation = (X new , Y new)Equation:This rotation is achieved by using the following rotation equations-● X new = X old x cosθ — Y old x sinθ● Y new = X old x sinθ + Y old x cosθMatrix Form:In Matrix form, the above rotation equations may be represented as-c. Scaling:In computer graphics, scaling is a process of modifying or altering the size of objects.Uses:● Scaling may be used to increase or reduce the size of objects.● Scaling subjects the coordinate points of the original object to change.● Scaling factor determines whether the object size is to be increased or reduced.● If scaling factor > 1, then the object size is increased.● If scaling factor < 1, then the object size is reduced.Explanation:Consider a point object O that has to be scaled in a 2D plane. Let● Initial coordinates of the object O = (Xold, Yold)● Scaling factor for X-axis = Sx● Scaling factor for Y-axis = Sy● New coordinates of the object O after scaling = (Xnew, Ynew)Equation:This scaling is achieved by using the following scaling equations-● Xnew = Xold x Sx● Ynew = Yold x SyMatrix Form:In Matrix form, the above scaling equations may be represented asSolved Examples:Example For Translation:Given a circle C with radius 10 and center coordinates (1, 4). Apply the translation with distance 5 towards X axis and 1 towards Y axis. Obtain the new coordinates of C.Solution:● Old center coordinates of C = (X old, Y old) = (1, 4)● Translation vector = (Tx, Ty) = (5, 1)Let the new center coordinates of C = (X new, Y new).In matrix form the new center coordinates of C after translation may be obtained as:Thus, New center coordinates of C=(6,5)Example for Scaling:Given a square object with coordinate points A(0, 3), B(3, 3), C(3, 0), D(0, 0). Apply the scaling parameter 2 towards X axis and 3 towards Y axis and obtain the new coordinates of the object.Solution:● Old corner coordinates of the square = A (0, 3), B(3, 3), C(3, 0), D(0, 0)● Scaling factor along X axis = 2● Scaling factor along Y axis = 3For Coordinates A(0,3):Let the new coordinates of corner A after scaling = (Xnew, Ynew).Applying the scaling equations, we have-● Xnew = Xold x Sx = 0 x 2 = 0● Ynew = Yold x Sy = 3 x 3 = 9Thus, New coordinates of corner A after scaling = (0, 9).For Coordinates B(3, 3):Let the new coordinates of corner B after scaling = (Xnew, Ynew).Applying the scaling equations, we have-● Xnew = Xold x Sx = 3 x 2 = 6● Ynew = Yold x Sy = 3 x 3 = 9Thus, New coordinates of corner B after scaling = (6, 9).For Coordinates C(3, 0)Let the new coordinates of corner C after scaling = (Xnew, Ynew).Applying the scaling equations, we have-● Xnew = Xold x Sx = 3 x 2 = 6● Ynew = Yold x Sy = 0 x 3 = 0Thus, New coordinates of corner C after scaling = (6, 0).For Coordinates D(0, 0)Let the new coordinates of corner D after scaling = (Xnew, Ynew).Applying the scaling equations, we have-● Xnew = Xold x Sx = 0 x 2 = 0● Ynew = Yold x Sy = 0 x 3 = 0Thus, New coordinates of corner D after scaling = (0, 0).So the new coordinates of the square after scaling = A (0, 9), B(6, 9), C(6, 0), D(0, 0).Example for Rotation:Given a line segment with starting point as (0, 0) and ending point as (4, 4). Apply 30 degree rotation anticlockwise direction on the line segment and find out the new coordinates of the line.Solution:We rotate a straight line by its end points with the same angle. Then, we re-draw a line between the new end points.● Old ending coordinates of the line = (Xold, Yold) = (4, 4)● Rotation angle = θ = 30ºLet new ending coordinates of the line after rotation = (Xnew, Ynew).In matrix form, the new ending coordinates of the line after rotation may be obtained as-Thus, New ending coordinates of the line after rotation = (1.46, 5.46).4) GRAPH THEORY:Graph theory is a branch of mathematics which deals with study of relations between points of a graph. A graph consists of two components: vertices and edges. Vertices represent objects and edges represent relation between two objects.There are various applications of graph theory in computer science. For example it is used in computer science and networking, social network analysis, flight and transport route management systems , traffic flow systems and transportation systems. By using techniques such as the adjacency matrix and matrix multiplication, we can analyze the connectivity and paths within a graph, such as the two-step and three-step systems. These systems provide valuable insights into the existence and count of paths between vertices, enabling us to understand the structure and relationships within a graph.Solved Example:The picture below shows how a flight management system works.The places on maps like Lihu ,Honolulu are endpoints/vertices of a graph and connections between two places are represented as edges of a graph. We can use an adjacency matrix to represent the connected areas on this map.For example, Lihu’s is connected to Honolulu, that’s why we put 1 under the heading of Honolulu and because Lihu’s is not directly connected to haiku and lanai we put 0 there.The adjacency matrix in above figure shows that we cannot go from one place to another which are not directly connected i.e which has values 0. To solve this issue we can use a 2 step system and 3 step system by taking the square and cube of a matrix.Two-step and Three-step system:In this system we multiply the adjacency matrix by itself as shown below:The above picture shows that If the entry at position (i, j) in A² is nonzero, it means there is at least one path of length two between vertex i and vertex j in the graph. On the other hand, if the entry is zero, it means there is no path of length two between the two vertices.For example there is only one path of length two in between Lanai to Lihue.Three step system also works the same as the two step system.In three step system If the entry at position (i, j) in A³ is nonzero, it indicates the existence of at least one path of length three between vertex i and vertex j. Conversely, if the entry is zero, it means there is no path of length three between the two vertices.● In the above diagram the Non-zero diagonals of matrix M3 signify that the point is involved in a clique● Matrix Mn represents the number of n-step paths from a point to another.● Diagonals of M3 represent the number of ways to get back to origin in 3 steps.5) ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS:One of the most apparent uses of linear algebra is that which is used inElectrical Engineering. As most students of mathematics have encountered, when thesubject of systems of equations is introduced, math class is temporarily converted into acrash course in electrical components. There, the resistor, voltage source and capacitortake the stage as well as their accompanying language consisting of Kirchoff and Ohm.With the basic concepts down, math class is resumed and students can look forward toplaying with n number of equations with n number of unknowns. To solve for thecurrents and voltages, students can use simplification and substitutions, but with manyequations, this task quickly becomes very time consuming and tedious.However, using Gaussian Elimination along with computers, engineers are able toefficiently calculate unknown values of extremely large and complex systems withoutperforming hundreds of calculations and exhaustive bookkeeping of values.Solved Examples:Example: Loop Current Analysis Using Gaussian EliminationLoop Equations:1i1 + 25(i1-i2) + 50(i1-i3) = 1025(i2- i1) + 30(i2- i4) + 1(i2- i3) = 050(i3- i1) + 1(i3- i2) + 55(i3-i4) = 055(i4- i3) + 30(i4- i2) + 25(i4-i5) + 50(i4- i6) = 025(i5- i4) + 30 i5+ 1(i5-i6) = 050(i6- i4) + 1(i6- i5) + 55 i6 = 0Collect terms:76i1–25i2–50i3 + 0 i4 + 0i5 + 0 i6 = 10-25i1 + 56 i2–1 i3–30 i4 + 0i5 + 0 i6 = 0-50i1 –1 i2 + 106 i3–55 i4 + 0 i5 + 0 i6 = 00i1 –30 i2–55 i3 +160 i4–25i5–50 i6 = 00i1 + 0 i2 + 0 i3 –25 i4 + 56i5–1i6 = 00i1 + 0i2 + 0i3–50 i4–1i5 + 106 i6 = 0Write as Augmented Matrix:76 –25 –50 0 0 0 10-25 56 –1 –30 0 0 0-50 –1 106 –55 0 0 00 –30 –55 160 –25 –50 00 0 0 –25 56 –1 00 0 0 –50 –1 106 0Row reduce using calculator or program:1 0 0 0 0 0 .4780 1 0 0 0 0 .3480 0 1 0 0 0 .3530 0 0 1 0 0 .2390 0 0 0 1 0 .1090 0 0 0 1 0 .114Answer:i1 = .478 A, i2 = .348 A, i3 = .353 A, i4 = .239 A, i5 = .109 A, i6 = .114 AREFERENCE:● CRYPTOGRAPHY:Websites:● Applications of Linear Algebra in Computer Science.● Applications of Linear Algebra in Computer Science | PDF● COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY:● Book Title: “Elementary Linear Algebra”● Author: Howard Anton● Website:Understanding the maths of Computed Tomography (CT) scans | R-bloggers● COMPUTER GRAPHICS:Websites:● Linear Algebra » Computer Graphics● 2D Translation in Computer Graphics | Definition | Examples | Gate Vidyalay● 2D Scaling in Computer Graphics | Definition | Examples | Gate Vidyalay● 2D Rotation in Computer Graphics | Definition | Examples | Gate Vidyalay● GRAPH THEORY● Book Title: “Elementary Linear Algebra”● Author: Howard Anton● Youtube Video: Graph Theory and Linear Algebra● ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING● Article: Electrical CircuitsLinear AlgebraComputer ScienceComputer VisionProgrammingData Science----FollowWritten by Sheeban Ali16 FollowersProgramming is like a cyanide more you taste more acrid it feel.FollowHelpStatusAboutCareersPressBlogPrivacyTermsText to speechTeams
