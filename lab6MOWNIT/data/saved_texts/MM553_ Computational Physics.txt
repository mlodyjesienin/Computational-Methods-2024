Co-read with MM837. Entry requirements
None Academic preconditions
Students taking the course are expected to have knowledge of:Differentiation and integration of functions of one and several variablesBasic concepts of linear algebra (vector spaces, matrices, eigenvalues ...)Ordinary Differential EquationsBasic programming. Course introduction
The aim of the course is to enable the student to apply computational 
methods in order to solve non-trivial problems in nonetheless practical 
and efficient way. Computational methods have become a standard approach
 in many areas of science, especially in condensed matter, particle 
physics, hydrodynamics,  plasma-dynamics, biophysics and chemistry.    The course provides tools to address problems which typically cannot be 
solved by analytical methods.The course builds on the knowledge acquired in the courses DM550 (Introduction
 to Programming) , MM547 (Ordinary Differential Equations: Theory, 
Modelling and Simulation ), MM536 (Calculus for Mathematics) and MM538 
(Algebra and Linear Algebra) .The course is of high 
multidisciplinary value and gives an academic basis for a Bachelor 
Project in several core areas of Natural Sciences.In relation to the competence profile of the degree it is the explicit focus of the course to:Give the competence to :handle complex and development-oriented situations in study and work contexts.to
 independently engage in disciplinary and interdisciplinary 
collaboration with a professional approach based on group -based 
project.Give skills to:analyze practical and theoretical problems with the help of numerical simulation based on a suitable mathematical model.analyze a mathematical model qualitative and quantitative traits.describe and evaluate sources of error for the modeling and calculation for a given problem.Give knowledge and understanding of:mathematical modeling and numerical analysis of problems in science and technology.how scientific knowledge is achieved by an interplay between theory, modeling and simulation. Expected learning outcome
The learning objectives of the course are that the student demonstrates the ability to:Demonstrate knowledge of the principles and algorithms covered during the courseSelect the most appropriate method to study numerically a givenphysical system.Implement solutions for new problems, based on the methods presented during the courseUnderstand and consequently  present  in both  written and oral forms the scientific results achieved. Content
The following main topics are contained in the course:Numerical methods for classical Hamiltonian systemsThe N-body problemIntegration schemesNumerical methods for Schroedinger equation in one dimensionMonte Carlo Simulations of Spin Systems:Markov chains and Metropolis algorithmCluster algorithmWang-Landau algorithmSimulation of two-dimensional modelsNumerical Simulation in Quantum Field TheoriesHeatbath algorithm for Yang-Mills theoriesHybrid Monte Carlo algorithm for matter fields Literature

In order to enable students to achieve the learning objectives for the course, the teaching is organised in such a way that there are 84 lectures, class lessons, etc. on a semester. These teaching activities are reflected in an estimated allocation of the workload of an average student as follows:Activities during the study phase:Intro phase (lectures, class lessons) - 56 hoursTraining phase: 28 hoursActivities during the studyphase:preparation of exercises in study groupspreparation of projects Teacher responsible
