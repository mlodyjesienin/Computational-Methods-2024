What is Topology?


















Topology
studies
properties
of
spaces
that
are
invariant
under
any
continuous
deformation.
It
is
sometimes
called
"rubber-sheet
geometry"
because
the
objects
can
be
stretched
and
contracted
like
rubber,
but
cannot
be
broken.
For
example,
a
square
can
be
deformed
into
a
circle
without
breaking
it,
but
a
figure
8
cannot.
Hence
a
square
is
topologically
equivalent
to
a
circle,
but
different
from
a
figure
8.




Here
are
some
examples
of
typical
questions
in
topology:
How
many
holes
are
there
in
an
object?
How
can
you
define
the
holes
in
a
torus
or
sphere?
What
is
the
boundary
of
an
object?
Is
a
space
connected?
Does
every
continuous
function
from
the
space
to
itself
have
a
fixed
point?

Topology
is
a
relatively
new
branch
of
mathematics;
most
of
the
research
in
topology
has
been
done
since
1900.
The
following
are
some
of
the
subfields
of
topology.



  General
  Topology
  or
  Point
  Set
  Topology. General
  topology
  normally
  considers
  local
  properties
  of
  spaces,
  and
  is
  closely
  related
  to
  analysis.
  It
  generalizes
  the
  concept
  of
  continuity
  to
  define
  topological
  spaces,
  in
  which
  limits
  of
  sequences
  can
  be
  considered.
  Sometimes
  distances
  can
  be
  defined
  in
  these
  spaces,
  in
  which
  case
  they
  are
  called
  metric
  spaces;
  sometimes
  no
  concept
  of
  distance
  makes
  sense.
  


  Combinatorial
  Topology. Combinatorial
  topology
  considers
  the
  global
  properties
  of
  spaces,
  built
  up
  from
  a
  network
  of
  vertices,
  edges,
  and
  faces.
  This
  is
  the
  oldest
  branch
  of
  topology,
  and
  dates
  back
  to
  Euler.
  It
  has
  been
  shown
  that
  topologically
  equivalent
  spaces
  have
  the
  same
  numerical
  invariant,
  which
  we
  now
  call
  the
  Euler
  characteristic.
  This
  is
  the
  number
  (V
  -
  E
  +
  F),
  where
  V,
  E,
  and
  F
  are
  the
  number
  of
  vertices,
  edges,
  and
  faces
  of
  an
  object.
  For
  example,
  a
  tetrahedron
  and
  a
  cube
  are
  topologically
  equivalent
  to
  a
  sphere,
  and
  any
  “triangulation”
  of
  a
  sphere
  will
  have
  an
  Euler
  characteristic
  of
  2.
  


  Algebraic
  Topology. Algebraic
  topology
  also
  considers
  the
  global
  properties
  of
  spaces,
  and
  uses
  algebraic
  objects
  such
  as
  groups
  and
  rings
  to
  answer
  topological
  questions.
  Algebraic
  topology
  converts
  a
  topological
  problem
  into
  an
  algebraic
  problem
  that
  is
  hopefully
  easier
  to
  solve.
  For
  example,
  a
  group
  called
  a
  homology
  group
  can
  be
  associated
  to
  each
  space,
  and
  the
  torus
  and
  the
  Klein
  bottle
  can
  be
  distinguished
  from
  each
  other
  because
  they
  have
  different
  homology
  groups.








        Torus
      

        Klein
        Bottle

Algebraic
topology
sometimes
uses
the
combinatorial
structure
of
a
space
to
calculate
the
various
groups
associated
to
that
space.



  Differential
  Topology. Differential
  topology
  considers
  spaces
  with
  some
  kind
  of
  smoothness
  associated
  to
  each
  point.
  In
  this
  case,
  the
  square
  and
  the
  circle
  would
  not
  be
  smoothly
  (or
  differentiably)
  equivalent
  to
  each
  other.
  Differential
  topology
  is
  useful
  for
  studying
  properties
  of
  vector
  fields,
  such
  as
  a
  magnetic
  or
  electric
  fields.

Topology
is
used
in
many
branches
of
mathematics,
such
as
differentiable
equations,
dynamical
systems,
knot
theory,
and
Riemann
surfaces
in
complex
analysis.
It
is
also
used
in
string
theory
in
physics,
and
for
describing
the
space-time
structure
of
universe.

The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg and Haudenosaunee peoples. Our main campus is situated on the Haldimand Tract, the land granted to the Six Nations that includes six miles on each side of the Grand River. Our active work toward reconciliation takes place across our campuses through research, learning, teaching, and community building, and is co-ordinated within the Office of Indigenous Relations.
