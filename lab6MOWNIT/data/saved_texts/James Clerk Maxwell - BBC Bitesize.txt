("How does that work?")He loved geometry (the maths of shapes) and published his first scientific paper on oval curves at the age of 14Most of his work was done on electricity, light and electromagnetism (a force that explains how magnetic and electric fields are connected, and how anything with a + or - charge reacts to them)He died in England on November 5th, 1879Image caption, In physics, Maxwell is considered as important as Isaac Newton and Albert EinsteinJames Clerk Maxwell and colourImage caption, The first colour photograph, taken by Maxwell in 1861 - courtesy of National Media Museum/SSPL James Clerk Maxwell made lots of discoveries about how we see light and colour.He worked out that any colour of light could be made by mixing different amounts of blue, green and red light. (A bit like mixing blue, yellow and red paints to make different colours),He showed this on a colour triangle (1855). Maxwell's theory is the idea behind how colour screens on computers and mobiles work.Maxwell invented colour photography (1861). He took photos using red, green and blue filters and then put the images together to make a colour image of a tartan ribbon.Image caption, The first colour photograph, taken by Maxwell in 1861 - courtesy of National Media Museum/SSPL Maxwell's colour wheelMaxwell made his colour wheel to experiment with mixing colours. He could change the amount of each colour on the wheel and then spin it fast to mix the colours. Different amounts of red, green and blue would result in different colours.Watch this video and see what happens when you spin Maxwell's wheel.This video can not be playedTo play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.Maxwell's colour wheelWhat is electromagnetism?Maxwell's most important work was showing that electricity and magnets are linked.In the past people thought that electricity and magnets were completely different things.Michael Faraday discovered that they were linked. He worked out that a moving magnet could make electricity flow through a wire. This is the basis for how all the electricity we use every day is generated.James Clerk Maxwell showed that electricity and magnetism create waves of electromagnetic energy. This includes light, x-rays, radio waves, microwaves and other types of energy we rely on.Maxwell figured out the maths behind electromagnetism (creating its theory in 1865) - other people then used his ideas to invent a wide range of things we use today, including mobile phones!We depend on electromagnetism every dayImage gallerySkip image galleryImage caption, Mobile phones send and receive data using radio waves - a type of electromagnetic wave, just like light, microwaves or x-rays.Image caption, We hear different sounds through earphones and speakers because of electromagnetism. Electromagnetism makes parts of the speakers move and this makes the sound waves that we hear.Image caption, In a buzzer doorbell an electromagnet makes an electric circuit open and close over and over again to make the buzzing noise. In other doorbells, the electromagnet moves a piston that hits a bell or bars to make the 'ding dong' sound.Image caption, Washing machines use electromagnets to turn the supply of water on and off.Image caption, Laptops use electromagnets to arrange how data and files are stored and read.1 of 5Previous imageNext imageSlide 1 of 5, , Mobile phones send and receive data using radio waves - a type of electromagnetic wave, just like light, microwaves or x-rays.End of image galleryMore on VictoriansFind out more by working through a topicRobert Owencount9 of 19Robert Stevenson and the Lighthouse Stevensonscount10 of 19Eliza Wighamcount11 of 19How Scotland changed during the Victorian eracount12 of 19Language:EnglishCymraegGaeilgeGÃ idhligCBBCCBBC iPlayerNewsroundBitesizeOwn ItCBeebiesCBBC on TVCBBC HelpTerms of UseAbout the BBCPrivacy PolicyCookiesAccessibility HelpParental GuidanceContact the BBCGet Personalised NewslettersWhy you can trust the BBCAdvertise with usÂ© 2024 BBC.
