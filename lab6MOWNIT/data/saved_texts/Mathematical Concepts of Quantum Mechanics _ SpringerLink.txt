About this book

The book gives a streamlined introduction to quantum mechanics while describing the basic mathematical structures underpinning this discipline. Starting with an overview of key physical experiments illustrating the origin of the physical foundations, the book proceeds with a description of the basic notions of quantum mechanics and their mathematical content.It then makes its way to topics of current interest, specifically those in which mathematics plays an important role. The more advanced topics presented include many-body systems, modern perturbation theory, path integrals, the theory of resonances, quantum statistics, mean-field theory, second quantization, the theory of radiation (non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics), and the renormalization group.With different selections of chapters, the book can serve as a text for an introductory, intermediate, or advanced course in quantum mechanics. The last four chapters could also serve as an introductory course in quantum field theory.



Reviews

From the reviews of the second edition:“This is the second edition of a readable introduction to modern mathematical topics in quantum mechanics intended for students of mathematics or physics. In comparison to the first edition the authors have tried to make the book more self-contained by adding further proofs and background material. … The overall style has not changed and with the extra background material it is now even better suited as the basis of a graduate course.” (G. Teschl, Monatshefte für Mathematik, Vol. 166 (2), May, 2012)
